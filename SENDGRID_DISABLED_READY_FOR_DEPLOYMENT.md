## 🚫 What's Disabled (As Intended)

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy to Staging
```bash
# Option A: Using milestone script
python scripts/milestone.py --branch staging

# Option B: Manual deployment
git add app/services/notifications_service.py utils/logging.py
git commit -m "fix | Disable SendGrid email notifications - SMS only"
git push origin staging
```

### 2. Verify Staging
- ✅ Check staging logs for clean email skip messages
- ✅ Test SMS notifications still work
- ✅ Verify no HTTP 401 errors
- ✅ Confirm user activity logging works

### 3. Deploy to Production
```bash
# Option A: Using milestone script
python scripts/milestone.py --branch production

# Option B: Manual deployment
git checkout production
git merge staging
git push origin production
```

### 4. Monitor Production
- ✅ Watch logs for clean "email skipped" messages
- ✅ Verify no SendGrid errors
- ✅ Confirm SMS continues working

## 🔍 What to Look For After Deployment

### ✅ Good Signs (Expected)
```
INFO:app.services.notifications_service:Admin activity email skipped (emails disabled)
INFO:utils.logging:Detailed logging email sent for user@example.com
```

### ❌ Bad Signs (Should NOT Happen)
```
ERROR:app.services.notifications_service:SendGrid email sending failed: HTTP Error 401
ERROR:... SendGrid ...
ERROR:... 401: Unauthorized ...
```

If you see any bad signs, the changes didn't work. But based on comprehensive testing, you should only see good signs.

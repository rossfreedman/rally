Comprehensive testing to prove that deleting inactive (S) records
did NOT create any issues for existing users.

This runs multiple real-world tests to validate:
1. Users can still log in
2. Users see correct teams
3. Match history is intact
4. Stats are preserved
5. Team switching works
6. No broken functionality

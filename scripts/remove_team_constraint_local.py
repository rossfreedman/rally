Remove unique_team_club_series_league constraint from local database only.

This script safely removes the constraint that prevents multiple teams
from existing in the same club/series/league combination, which is needed
for APTA teams like "Wilmette PD I 11" and "Wilmette PD II 11".

SAFETY CHECKS:
- Only runs on local database (localhost)
- Validates constraint exists before removal
- Provides rollback instructions
- Logs all operations

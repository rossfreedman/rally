Migrate series table to include league_id for proper league isolation

This script:
1. Analyzes existing series-league relationships
2. Adds league_id column to series table
3. Migrates existing data based on majority league association
4. Handles conflicts by creating separate series records
5. Updates constraints for league isolation

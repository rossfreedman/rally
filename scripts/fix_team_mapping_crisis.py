Fix Team Mapping Crisis

This script addresses the root cause of team assignment issues:
missing team_format_mappings between match data team names and teams table names.

The script will:
1. Identify teams in match data that don't exist in teams table
2. Find potential mappings to existing teams
3. Create team_format_mappings entries to resolve the crisis
4. Validate the fix by re-running team assignments

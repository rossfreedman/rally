"""
Enhanced ETL Club Import with Logo Preservation

This script modifies the ETL import process to preserve club logo filenames
when clubs are recreated during season imports.

The issue: end_season.py deletes clubs, then start_season.py recreates them
without preserving the logo_filename values that were manually set.

Solution: Backup logo filenames before ETL, restore them after ETL.

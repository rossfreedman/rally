Merge career stats from player_history.json into players.json

This script:
1. Loads both players.json and player_history.json
2. Creates a lookup dictionary from player_history.json using player_id as key
3. Updates each player in players.json with Career Wins and Career Losses from history
4. Preserves existing Wins/Losses (current season) and adds Career Wins/Career Losses
5. Saves the updated players.json

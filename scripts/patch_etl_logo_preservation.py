Fix ETL Club Upsert Functions to Preserve Logo Filenames

This script patches the upsert_club functions in the ETL import scripts
to preserve existing logo_filename values when upserting clubs.

The issue: ETL import scripts use upsert_club() which only handles name/league_id
but doesn't preserve logo_filename values that were manually set.

Solution: Modify upsert_club functions to preserve existing logo_filename values.

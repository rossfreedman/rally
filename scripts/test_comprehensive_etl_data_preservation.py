"""
Comprehensive test script for the new ETL data preservation system.

This script tests the backup and restore functionality for:
1. Polls with precise team context
2. Captain messages with precise team context  
3. Practice times with precise team context
4. User associations and availability data
5. League contexts

The script creates test data, runs the backup/restore process, and validates results.

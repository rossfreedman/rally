Test script to merge one series: "5" ‚Üí "Series 5"

This script safely merges the incorrect series "5" into the correct "Series 5"
by:
1. Deleting duplicate players from incorrect series
2. Updating teams to point to correct series
3. Deleting the incorrect series record

SAFETY CHECKS:
- Only runs on local database
- Validates data before and after
- Provides detailed logging
- Can be rolled back if needed

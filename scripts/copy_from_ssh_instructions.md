# Copy JSON Files from Production via SSH

Since `railway run` isn't working reliably, use these commands directly in your SSH session:

## Step 1: In Your SSH Session

```bash
# Create tar archive
cd /app/data/leagues
tar -czf /tmp/production_json_files.tar.gz \
  CNSWPL/cnswpl_match_history_2024_2025.json \
  CNSWPL/cnswpl_players_career_stats.json \
  APTA_CHICAGO/match_history_2024_2025.json \
  APTA_CHICAGO/player_history.json \
  APTA_CHICAGO/players_career_stats.json

# Check the archive
ls -lh /tmp/production_json_files.tar.gz
```

## Step 2: Copy Individual Files (Alternative)

If tar doesn't work, you can copy/paste individual files:

```bash
# CNSWPL files
cat /app/data/leagues/CNSWPL/cnswpl_match_history_2024_2025.json
# Copy the output and save to: data/leagues/CNSWPL/cnswpl_match_history_2024_2025.json

cat /app/data/leagues/CNSWPL/cnswpl_players_career_stats.json

# APTA_CHICAGO files  
cat /app/data/leagues/APTA_CHICAGO/match_history_2024_2025.json
cat /app/data/leagues/APTA_CHICAGO/player_history.json
cat /app/data/leagues/APTA_CHICAGO/players_career_stats.json
```

## Step 3: Base64 Encode (for large files)

For very large files like `player_history.json` (53MB), use base64:

```bash
# In SSH session
base64 /app/data/leagues/APTA_CHICAGO/player_history.json > /tmp/player_history_base64.txt

# Then copy the base64 text and decode locally:
# base64 -d player_history_base64.txt > data/leagues/APTA_CHICAGO/player_history.json
```

## Files Available on Production:

**CNSWPL:**
- cnswpl_match_history_2024_2025.json (1.8M)
- cnswpl_players_career_stats.json (1.4M)

**APTA_CHICAGO:**
- match_history_2024_2025.json (11M)
- player_history.json (53M) ⚠️ Very large!
- players_career_stats.json (3.7M)

## Note:

The following files **don't exist** on production (they're generated by scrapers during import):
- series_stats.json
- match_scores.json
- schedules.json
- players.json

These are created temporarily during the scraping/import process and not stored permanently.

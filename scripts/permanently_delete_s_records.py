"""
Permanently delete inactive (S) player records from the database.

WHAT THIS DOES:
- Deletes all player records where (first_name or last_name contains "(S)") AND is_active = false
- Does NOT delete user accounts, contexts, or associations
- Only removes the inactive player records themselves

SAFETY:
- Only deletes inactive records (is_active = false)
- Validates no foreign key constraints would be violated
- Creates backup recommendations
- Includes dry-run mode

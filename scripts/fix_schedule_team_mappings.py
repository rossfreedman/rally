Fix Schedule Team Mappings
==========================

This script fixes the existing schedule data by properly mapping team_ids
for matches that were imported with NULL team_ids due to team name format mismatches.

The issue: Schedule data has team names like "Tennaqua S2B - Series 2B" 
but teams table has "Tennaqua S2B", causing NULL team_id mappings.

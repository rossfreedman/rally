DEPRECATED: Import career stats from player_history.json into players table career stats columns

‚ö†Ô∏è  DEPRECATION NOTICE:
This standalone script is now DEPRECATED as of 2025-06-16.
Career stats import is now integrated into the main ETL script:
    python etl/database_import/json_import_all_to_database.py

This script is kept for backward compatibility but should not be used.
Use the main ETL script instead, which imports career stats automatically.

Fix Orphaned Availability Data
===============================

This script fixes player_availability records that have orphaned player_id values
after ETL imports that recreate the players table with new auto-increment IDs.

The script:
1. Identifies availability records with player_id values that don't exist in players table
2. Attempts to match them to current players by name and series
3. Updates the player_id values to the correct current IDs
4. Reports on successful matches and unresolved orphans

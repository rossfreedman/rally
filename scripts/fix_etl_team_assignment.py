# ETL Enhancement Patch - Fix Team Assignment Logic
# Apply to data/etl/database_import/import_all_jsons_to_database.py

## Problem
The current ETL team assignment logic fails when series names don't match exactly:
- Player series: "Series 2B" 
- Team series: "S2B"
- JOIN fails: t.series_id = s.id returns NULL

## Solution
Replace the problematic JOIN in import_players() around line 2265:

### OLD CODE (problematic):
```sql
LEFT JOIN teams t ON t.club_id = c.id AND t.series_id = s.id AND t.league_id = l.id
```

### NEW CODE (enhanced):
```sql
LEFT JOIN teams t ON (
    t.club_id = c.id AND 
    t.league_id = l.id AND
    (
        -- Direct series match
        t.series_id = s.id
        OR
        -- NSTF fallback: match team_alias to series name
        (t.team_alias IS NOT NULL AND t.team_alias = s.name)
        OR
        -- Series name variations (S2B ‚Üî Series 2B)
        (s.name LIKE 'S%%' AND t.series_id IN (
            SELECT id FROM series WHERE name = 'Series ' || SUBSTRING(s.name, 2)
        ))
        OR
        (s.name LIKE 'Series %%' AND t.series_id IN (
            SELECT id FROM series WHERE name = 'S' || SUBSTRING(s.name, 8)
        ))
    )
)
```

## Implementation Steps
1. Update the JOIN logic in import_players() method
2. Add validation to ensure team_id is assigned
3. Add logging for failed team assignments
4. Test with NSTF data to verify fixes

## Expected Results
- All players should have team_id assigned during ETL
- Captain messages API will work correctly
- No more "Team ID not found" errors

Fix all team points in series_stats table by recalculating from match history

‚ö†Ô∏è  ONE-TIME FIX SCRIPT: This addresses historical data with incorrect points.
‚ö†Ô∏è  ROOT CAUSE FIXED: ETL process now calculates points correctly during import.

This script recalculates points based on actual match performance:

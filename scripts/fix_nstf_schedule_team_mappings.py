Fix NSTF Schedule Team Mappings
===============================

This script specifically fixes NSTF schedule data by properly mapping team_ids
for matches that were imported with NULL team_ids due to NSTF team name format mismatches.

The issue: NSTF schedule data has team names like "Wilmette S1 T1 - Series 1" 
but teams table has "Wilmette S1 T1", causing NULL team_id mappings.

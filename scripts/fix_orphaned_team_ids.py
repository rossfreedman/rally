Fix Orphaned Team IDs in Match Scores
=====================================

This script fixes orphaned team_id references in the match_scores table by
mapping team names to their correct team IDs from the teams table.

The issue: Many matches have team_ids that don't exist in the teams table,
causing analyze-me pages to show 0 matches when filtering by team.

The solution: Map team names (home_team/away_team) to existing team IDs.

Usage:

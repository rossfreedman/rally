ID-BASED LOOKUP AUDIT SUMMARY & STANDARDS
==========================================

This script documents the comprehensive audit of name-based vs ID-based lookups
and establishes standards for future development.

COMPLETED FIXES:
1. ‚úÖ Series API - Fixed incomplete series_leagues junction table dependency
2. ‚úÖ Session Service - All ID-based JOINs (team_id, league_id, series_id) 
3. ‚úÖ Registration System - ID-based primary with name-based fallbacks
4. ‚úÖ Database Schema - Aligned UserContext columns (team_id/league_id)
5. ‚úÖ Series_leagues Table - 100% coverage verified across all leagues
6. ‚úÖ ETL Process - Properly maintains series_leagues during imports

REMAINING NAME-BASED PATTERNS (Low Priority):
- Some mobile service queries use team_name for display (acceptable)
- Admin service has club_name/series_name lookups (low usage)
- Legacy match utils for scraping (acceptable for external data)

ID-BASED LOOKUP STANDARDS:
==========================

1. PRIMARY RULE: Always use database IDs for lookups when available
   ‚úÖ Good: WHERE p.series_id = %s
   ‚ùå Bad:  WHERE s.name = %s

2. FALLBACK RULE: Name-based lookups only for user input/external data
   ‚úÖ Good: User registration with series_name fallback
   ‚ùå Bad:  Internal system queries using names

3. JOIN RULE: Use ID-based JOINs for all internal database operations
   ‚úÖ Good: JOIN teams t ON p.team_id = t.id
   ‚ùå Bad:  JOIN teams t ON t.team_name = p.team_name

4. API RULE: Always return objects with IDs for downstream operations
   ‚úÖ Good: {"id": 21801, "name": "Chicago 22", "display": "Chicago 22"}
   ‚ùå Bad:  "Chicago 22"

5. CACHING RULE: Cache lookups by ID, not by name
   ‚úÖ Good: cache[series_id] = series_data
   ‚ùå Bad:  cache[series_name] = series_data

Fix Unknown Series ETL Issue
============================

This script fixes the ETL issue where ~4,081 records in player_history.json
have "Unknown" series and clubs, causing player lookups to fail.

Solution approaches:
1. Filter out records with "Unknown" series/clubs
2. Attempt to infer correct series/clubs from other data sources  
3. Create a clean dataset for ETL processing

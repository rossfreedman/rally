Remote Database Update Script
============================

This script updates both staging and production databases with:
1. Missing clubs that cause ETL import failures
2. Tests the improved ETL import process
3. Validates Anne Mooney's data import

Usage:
    python scripts/remote_database_update.py --environment staging
    python scripts/remote_database_update.py --environment production
    python scripts/remote_database_update.py --environment both

Remove Series 22 (Chicago 22) Data from Local Database
======================================================

This script safely removes all Series 22 (Chicago 22) data from the local database
for testing purposes. It removes data from multiple tables that reference Series 22.

Tables affected:
- series_stats (team statistics for Series 22)
- match_scores (match results for Series 22 teams)
- schedule (scheduled matches for Series 22 teams)
- teams (team records for Series 22)

Safety features:
- Shows what will be deleted before executing
- Creates backup of affected data
- Confirms before deletion
- Provides rollback instructions

Usage:
    python scripts/remove_series_22_data.py [--dry-run] [--force]

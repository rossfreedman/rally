Comprehensive Series Merge Script

This script merges all remaining incorrect series names into their correct "Series X" format.
It performs comprehensive validation before, during, and after the merge process.

SERIES TO MERGE:
- "13" ‚Üí "Series 13"
- "17" ‚Üí "Series 17" 
- "21" ‚Üí "Series 21"
- "23" ‚Üí "Series 23"
- "29" ‚Üí "Series 29"
- "32" ‚Üí "Series 32"
- "33" ‚Üí "Series 33"
- "6" ‚Üí "Series 6"
- "9" ‚Üí "Series 9"

SAFETY FEATURES:
- Only runs on local database
- Comprehensive pre-merge validation
- Detailed logging of all operations
- Post-merge validation
- Rollback instructions
- Progress tracking

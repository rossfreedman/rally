These {len(orphaned_teams)} teams are safe to delete because:

1. ‚úÖ Zero players registered to these teams
2. ‚úÖ Zero matches played by these teams (no home_team_id or away_team_id references)
3. ‚úÖ Zero schedule entries for these teams
4. ‚úÖ Zero series stats records for these teams

These are "ghost" teams created by bootstrap processes but never populated with actual data.
They exist in the database but have never been used by any real users or matches.

Deleting them will:
- ‚úÖ Clean up database (reduce from 941 to 836 teams)
- ‚úÖ Eliminate confusion from empty team pages
- ‚úÖ Fix issues like Tennaqua 3 appearing in wrong league
- ‚úÖ Improve query performance (11% fewer teams to scan)
- ‚úÖ NOT affect any real users or matches (zero data loss)

2. User submits registration → `/api/register` processes ✅

5. User can then access `/mobile/home` (new dashboard) ✅

### Key Findings:

#### ✅ Registration Works Perfectly

- Form validation works (phone numbers, required fields)
- API endpoints respond properly
- Error handling works for invalid data

#### ✅ New Home Page Integration
- The new home page (`/mobile/home`) is properly integrated
- Route protection works correctly
- Users will be redirected to login if not authenticated
- After successful registration/login, users can access the new dashboard

#### ✅ Backwards Compatibility
- Old routes (`/mobile/main-alt`, `/mobile/alt1`) redirect to new home
- Classic view available at `/mobile/classic`
- All existing functionality preserved

## Test Commands Used

```bash
# Start server
PORT=4000 python server.py

# Test registration page
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:4000/register

# Test registration API
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "testpass123", ...}'

# Test mobile home
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:4000/mobile/home
```

## Conclusion

**✅ REGISTRATION IS FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE NEW HOME PAGE**

The migration from the classic button-menu home page to the modern dashboard (`main-alt` → `home`) does not break the registration flow. Users can:

1. Register successfully
2. Be redirected to welcome page
3. Access the new modern dashboard at `/mobile/home`
4. Switch between classic and modern views as needed

The new home page provides a much better user experience with:
- Modern hero section with PTI display
- Card-based layout for matches, teammates, videos, lessons
- Sticky navigation
- Better visual design

**No issues found with registration functionality.**

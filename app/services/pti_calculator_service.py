PTI Calculator Service - Implements Glicko-2 Rating System for Platform Tennis

This service provides PTI (Platform Tennis Index) calculations based on the Glicko-2 
rating system algorithm, adapted for platform tennis matches.

Key Features:
- Converts between PTI ratings and internal Glicko-2 parameters (mu, phi, sigma)
- Parses match scores and calculates rating adjustments
- Handles team-based matches with partners and opponents
- Provides before/after rating comparisons

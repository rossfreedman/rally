PTI Calculator Service v2.0
Based on reverse-engineered algorithm from original calc.platform.tennis site

Key findings:
- Base K-factor: 32.0 for experienced players (30+ matches)
- Experience multipliers: New=2.19x, 1-10=1.56x, 10-30=1.25x, 30+=1.0x
- Expected probability: Standard Elo formula
- Adjustment = K-factor * |actual - expected|

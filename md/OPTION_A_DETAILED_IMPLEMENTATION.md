# Option A: Post-Import Resolution - Detailed Implementation Guide

## Executive Summary

**What**: Add a post-processing step after match import that corrects ~2,500 misassigned team matches in APTA_CHICAGO.

**Where**: New module `data/etl/resolvers/match_team_resolver.py` + integration into `import_match_scores.py`

**Risk Level**: 🟢 LOW (with proper safeguards)

**Impact**: Fixes 94% of all data quality issues permanently

---

## How It Works - The Algorithm

### Current Problem Flow

```
1. Scraper extracts from HTML: "Wilmette PD - 2 @ Tennaqua - 26"
2. Scraper creates team names: 
   - "Wilmette PD 2" (WRONG - should be "26")
   - "Tennaqua 26" (CORRECT)
3. Match imports with WRONG team assignments
4. UI displays incorrect data
```

### Proposed Solution Flow

```
1. Scraper extracts from HTML (unchanged): "Wilmette PD - 2 @ Tennaqua - 26"
2. Match imports with WRONG team assignments (unchanged)
3. ⭐ NEW: Post-processing step analyzes match players
4. ⭐ NEW: Determines correct teams from player data
5. ⭐ NEW: Updates team_id and team_name to correct values
6. UI displays CORRECT data ✅
```

### The Resolution Algorithm

```python
def resolve_match_team_assignments(cur, league_id):
    """
    Core algorithm: Democratic voting by players
    
    For each misassigned match:
    1. Collect all 4 player IDs (home_p1, home_p2, away_p1, away_p2)
    2. Look up which team each player belongs to in database
    3. Count votes: team_id → number of players from that team
    4. Majority rule: Team with 3+ votes wins
    5. Update match record
    
    Example:
    Match 12345: home_team_id=59385 ("Wilmette PD 2")
    Players: [Mike, Bob, Rob, Ross]
    Player lookups:
      Mike → team 59947
      Bob → team 59947  
      Rob → team 59947
      Ross → team 59947
    Result: 4 votes for team 59947
    Update: home_team_id=59947, home_team="Wilmette PD 26" ✅
    """

Match Team Resolution Module

Resolves correct team assignments for matches based on player data.
Addresses the issue where scraper extracts wrong team names from HTML,
leading to ~2,500 misassigned matches in APTA_CHICAGO league.

Algorithm:
- For each match, collect all 4 player IDs
- Look up which team each player belongs to
- Use majority rule to determine correct team
- Update match record if confidence threshold met

Confidence Threshold: 60% (3 out of 4 players must agree)

## Integration into Existing Code

### Modification to `data/etl/import/import_match_scores.py`

Add this import at the top:

```python
# Add after other imports
from data.etl.resolvers import resolve_match_team_assignments
```

Modify the `main()` function to call resolver after import:

```python
def main():
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Import match scores (existing)
    print("Importing match scores...")
    inserted, updated, existing, skipped, validation_failed = import_match_scores(cur, league_id, matches_data)
    
    # NEW: Resolve team assignments
    print("\n🔧 Resolving team assignments from player data...")
    resolution_stats = resolve_match_team_assignments(
        cur,
        league_id=league_id,
        confidence_threshold=0.6,
        dry_run=False
    )
    print(f"Team resolution: {resolution_stats['updated']} updated, "
          f"{resolution_stats['skipped']} skipped, "
          f"{resolution_stats['errors']} errors")
    
    # Existing integrity checks
    integrity_issues = run_integrity_checks(cur, league_id)
    
    # Commit transaction
    conn.commit()
    # ... rest of existing code ...
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Unit Tests

Create `tests/test_match_team_resolver.py`:

```python
import pytest
from data.etl.resolvers.match_team_resolver import (
    build_player_teams_cache,
    get_team_votes_for_match,
    resolve_single_match,
)

def test_confidence_calculation():
    """Test that confidence threshold works correctly."""
    # Mock data: 4 players, 3 from Team A, 1 from Team B
    match = {
        'id': 1,
        'home_player_1_id': 'player_A_1',
        'home_player_2_id': 'player_A_2',
        'away_player_1_id': 'player_A_3',
        'away_player_2_id': 'player_B_1',
        'home_team_id': 999,  # Wrong team
        'away_team_id': 888,
    }
    
    cache = {
        'player_A_1': 1,
        'player_A_2': 1,

    votes = get_team_votes_for_match(match, cache)
    assert votes[1] == 3  # Team 1 has 3 votes
    assert votes[2] == 1  # Team 2 has 1 vote

        'id': 2,
        'home_player_1_id': 'player_A_1',
        'home_player_2_id': 'player_A_2',
        'away_player_1_id': 'player_B_1',
        'away_player_2_id': 'player_B_2',
        'home_team_id': 999,
        'away_team_id': 888,
    }
    
    cache = {
        'player_A_1': 1,
        'player_A_2': 1,
        'player_B_1': 2,

    # Should skip due to tie (requires 60% confidence = 3+ votes)
    assert len([v for v in votes.values() if v >= 3]) == 0
```

### Phase 2: Local Database Testing

```bash
# 1. Backup local database
python cb.py local

# 2. Run with dry-run first
python data/etl/import/import_match_scores.py APTA_CHICAGO --dry-run

# 3. Review logs to see what would be changed
# Look for: "Match X: Updated teams (confidence: Y%)"

# 4. Run actual import on small subset
python data/etl/import/import_match_scores.py APTA_CHICAGO --limit 100

# 5. Verify a sample of changes manually
# Check: Does match now show correct team names?

# 6. Run full import
python data/etl/import/import_match_scores.py APTA_CHICAGO
```

### Phase 3: Staging Validation

```bash
# 1. Run on staging with dry-run
# Review all proposed changes

# 2. Run actual import on staging subset
# Validate team assignments

# 3. Run full import
# Monitor logs for errors

# 4. Verify UI displays correct data
```

### Phase 4: Production Deployment

```bash
# 1. Backup production database
python cb.py production

# 2. Run dry-run on production
# Verify proposed changes look correct

# 3. Run actual import
# Monitor closely

# 4. Verify results in UI
```

## Performance Optimization

### Current Performance Estimate

**Without caching**:
- 4 player lookups per match × 2,500 matches = 10,000 queries
- At 1ms per query = **10 seconds**

**With caching**:
- 1 cache build query (all players) = 1 query
- Hash map lookups × 10,000 = negligible
- Batch updates in CTEs = **~2 seconds total**

### Optimized Cache Build Query

```python
def build_player_teams_cache_optimized(cur, league_id):
    """Optimized version using single query with CTEs."""
    query = """
    WITH player_team_counts AS (
        SELECT 
            p.tenniscores_player_id,
            p.team_id,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
                PARTITION BY p.tenniscores_player_id 
                ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC, MAX(p.id) DESC
            ) as rn
        FROM players p
        WHERE p.team_id IS NOT NULL
        AND (%s IS NULL OR p.league_id = %s)
        GROUP BY p.tenniscores_player_id, p.team_id
    )
    SELECT tenniscores_player_id, team_id
    FROM player_team_counts
    WHERE rn = 1
    """
    
    cur.execute(query, (league_id, league_id))
    return {row[0]: row[1] for row in cur.fetchall()}
```

## Expected Results

### Before Fix

Result: WRONG - All 4 players are from different team!
```

### After Fix

```
Match 12345: home_team_id=59947, home_team="Wilmette PD 26"
Players: Mike (team 59947), Bob (team 59947), Rob (team 59947), Ross (team 59947)
Result: ✅ CORRECT - Match assigned to proper team
```

### Statistics Expected

- **Updated**: ~2,500 matches (majority rule success)
- **Skipped**: ~500 matches (ambiguous or low confidence)
- **Errors**: ~0 (robust error handling)

---

## Edge Case Handling

### Case 1: Substitute Players (1-2 players from different team)

**Example**: Match has 3 regular players + 1 substitute from another team

**Behavior**: 3 votes for Team A, 1 vote for Team B  
**Result**: ✅ Updates to Team A (75% confidence > 60% threshold)

**Rationale**: Correct - match belongs to Team A, sub is temporary

### Case 2: Equal Split (2v2)

**Example**: 2 players from Team A, 2 players from Team B

**Behavior**: 2 votes each, 50% confidence  
**Result**: ❌ Skip (50% < 60% threshold)

**Rationale**: Can't determine with confidence - requires manual review

### Case 3: Multi-team Player

**Example**: Player John is on Team A and Team B

**Behavior**: Cache picks most frequent team  
**Result**: ✅ Uses most common team assignment

**Rationale**: Conservative approach - use best available information

### Case 4: Missing Players

**Example**: Match has NULL for home_player_2_id

**Behavior**: Only 3 player lookups, not 4  
**Result**: ✅ Still works with 3+ votes

**Rationale**: Flexible - works with partial data

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Arise

**Simple Case**:
```bash
# Revert code change
git checkout data/etl/import/import_match_scores.py

# Re-import from JSON
python data/etl/import/import_match_scores.py APTA_CHICAGO
```

**Data Rollback**:
```bash
# Restore from backup
python cb.py --restore local_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql
```

Comprehensive CNSWPL Roster Scraper

This script systematically scrapes ALL CNSWPL series (1-17 and A-K) directly from 
team roster pages to capture every registered player, including those in missing 
series like H, I, J, K, 13, 15, etc.

Unlike the match-based scraper, this goes directly to team/roster pages to find
ALL registered players, not just those who have played matches.

Usage:

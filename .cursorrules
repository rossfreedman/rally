# General AI Behavior
- Think step-by-step before proposing changes.
- Always explain your thought process clearly and briefly before editing or suggesting code.
- Confirm the goal of the task or user intent if ambiguous.
- Minimize disruption to surrounding logic â€” avoid breaking existing functionality.
- Always back up or checkpoint modified code (e.g., via comments or git commit suggestions).
- Proactively suggest improvements to performance, readability, or structure if they are high-impact.

# Code Style
- Write modular, reusable code with a component-based mindset. 
- Don't let any one code file get too large.  Always look to modularize code in an elegant and efficient way to ensure code sustainability
- Follow PEP8 for Python, and Airbnb/Prettier style guides for JavaScript and React.
- Use modern ES6+ syntax in JavaScript unless otherwise specified.
- Prefer functional React components with hooks over class-based components.
- Use clear naming conventions: avoid abbreviations, use snake_case in Python, camelCase in JS/React.
- Don't use bootstrap. Use Flask + Jinja + Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI for the Rally application.
- Aside from ETL commands, do not let the front end application query JSON files. All queries should access the Postgres database.
- Do NOT use SQLite. All database related queries should be with Postgres

# Documentation & Comments
- Verbosely document all new functions, components, and complex logic.
- In Python, use docstrings (Google-style or reStructuredText) for all functions and classes.
- In JavaScript/React, use inline comments for complex logic and JSDoc for utility functions when appropriate.
- Comment any refactors or non-obvious changes with rationale.

# Project-Specific Practices
- When working with Flask, maintain a clear separation of concerns between routes, logic, and templates.
- When working with React, prioritize composability and avoid deeply nested components.
- When suggesting backend changes, consider compatibility with Railway deployment (e.g., environment variables, file structure).
- Use `.env` for sensitive configuration and remind me if hardcoding is detected.
- Use Alembic for all database related management tasks (migrations, cloning, table updates, field updates, etc.)
- Do not write code that pulls data from json files within the application.  All data queries need to come from the postgres database.
- When creating temporary scripts to fix or check things create them in teh scrpts folder.
- Always ask to clean up files that don't need to be used in the root so it stays clean with only essential files.

# Communication Style
- Ask clarifying questions when unsure about instructions.
- Use markdown formatting for code blocks, bullet points, and clear visual structure in explanations.
- If you detect repeated patterns in the project, suggest refactoring opportunities proactively.

# Safeguards
- Remind me periodically to test my changes in a dev/staging environment.
- If a change could introduce bugs or technical debt, flag it with a warning and suggest mitigation.

# Database Updates
- Use database migrations consistently across all environments
- Keep SQLAlchemy models in sync with actual database schema
- Test registration flows in staging before production deployment
- Consider database schema comparison scripts to catch drift early

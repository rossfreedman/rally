# 🏆 Team-Specific Tracking Fix

## 🚨 Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Players with multiple teams in the same league were seeing the same tracking data (forced byes, unavailability, injury) across all teams on the `/mobile/track-byes-courts` page.

**Root Cause**: The `player_season_tracking` table was missing a `team_id` field, causing data to be shared between teams.

**Solution**: Added `team_id` column and updated the system to support team-specific tracking data.

## 🛠️ What Was Fixed

### Database Schema
- ✅ Added `team_id` column to `player_season_tracking` table
- ✅ Updated unique constraint to include `team_id`
- ✅ Added foreign key relationship to teams table

### API Endpoints
- ✅ Updated `/api/player-season-tracking` to filter by team
- ✅ Modified UPSERT operations to include `team_id`
- ✅ Ensured team-specific data retrieval

### Application Code
- ✅ Updated database models with new relationships
- ✅ Modified mobile routes to use team context
- ✅ Enhanced data filtering logic

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### 1. Run Migration
```bash
cd /path/to/rally
python scripts/add_team_id_to_player_season_tracking.py
```

### 2. Test the Fix
```bash
python scripts/test_team_specific_tracking.py
```

### 3. Verify in UI
- Navigate to `/mobile/track-byes-courts`
- Switch between different teams for multi-team players
- Confirm tracking data is different per team

## 📁 Files Modified

- `database_schema/rally_schema.dbs` - Added team_id column
- `app/models/database_models.py` - Updated PlayerSeasonTracking model
- `app/routes/api_routes.py` - Modified API endpoints
- `scripts/add_team_id_to_player_season_tracking.py` - Migration script
- `scripts/test_team_specific_tracking.py` - Test script
- `docs/TEAM_SPECIFIC_TRACKING_FIX.md` - Comprehensive documentation

## 🎯 Benefits

- **Data Separation**: Each team now has independent tracking data
- **User Experience**: Players see correct data for their current team
- **Data Integrity**: Proper constraints prevent data corruption
- **Scalability**: Foundation for future team-specific features

## 🔍 Testing

The fix includes comprehensive testing:
- ✅ Multi-team player scenarios
- ✅ API endpoint compatibility
- ✅ Data separation verification
- ✅ Constraint validation

## 📚 Documentation

- **Technical Details**: See `docs/TEAM_SPECIFIC_TRACKING_FIX.md`
- **Migration Guide**: Follow the migration script output
- **Testing Guide**: Use the test script for verification

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Backup**: The migration script is safe but always backup your database first
- **Deployment**: Deploy database changes before application code
- **Monitoring**: Watch for any issues after deployment
- **Rollback**: Rollback plan included in documentation if needed

## 🎉 Result

Players with multiple teams in the same league now see accurate, team-specific tracking data on the Track Byes & Courts page. Each team can manage their own forced byes, unavailability, and injury tracking independently.

   - Court 2 = NEXT LOWEST PTI players (e.g., 50.40, 50.90)  
   - Court 3 = HIGHER PTI players (e.g., 55.90, 56.30)
   - Court 4 = HIGHEST PTI players (e.g., 58.90, 59.90)

2. **Partnership Consistency**: Prioritize players who have successful win rates together
   - Look for pairings with 60%+ win rates and multiple matches played
   - Consider recent partnership success over isolated good results

3. **Ad/Deuce Court Positioning**: Ad players should be paired with Deuce players when possible
   - This creates optimal court coverage and reduces confusion
   - If position preferences aren't available, pair based on other factors

4. **Win Percentage Override**: Players with exceptionally high individual win rates can play lower courts even if their PTI is higher, unless their combined PTI significantly exceeds the norm

**REASONING REQUIREMENTS:**
- Reference specific PTI numbers, win/loss records, and partnership statistics
- Mention successful pairing history with actual win rates when relevant
- Explain court assignment logic based on PTI + partnership success
- Note any strategic positioning considerations (Ad/Deuce when known)

**Required Format:**
Court 1: Player1/Player2 - [PTI: X/Y, reasoning: specific data-driven explanation]
Court 2: Player3/Player4 - [PTI: X/Y, reasoning: specific data-driven explanation]
Court 3: Player5/Player6 - [PTI: X/Y, reasoning: specific data-driven explanation]
Court 4: Player7/Player8 - [PTI: X/Y, reasoning: specific data-driven explanation]

**FORBIDDEN** - Do NOT use vague phrases like:
- "Strong net play" / "baseline consistency" / "tactical awareness"
- "Experience" / "communication" / "strategic play"
- Any playing style characteristics not shown in the data

Focus ONLY on: PTI scores, actual win/loss records, proven partnership success rates, and court positioning strategy."""

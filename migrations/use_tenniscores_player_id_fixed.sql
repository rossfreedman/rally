-- Migration: Use tenniscores_player_id in User Player Associations
-- ===========================================================
-- This migration changes user_player_associations to use stable
-- tenniscores_player_id + league_id instead of auto-generated player_id
-- This makes user associations ETL-resilient.

-- SAFETY CHECKS BEFORE MIGRATION
-- ==============================

-- Check 1: Verify all players have tenniscores_player_id

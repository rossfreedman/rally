# Rally Database Schema Migration Summary

## Migration Status: âœ… COMPLETED

### What Was Changed:
1. **Removed `tenniscores_player_id` column from `users` table**
   - This field was redundant with the new association system
   
2. **Now using `user_player_associations` table for user-player relationships**
   - Supports many-to-many relationships (users can have multiple players)
   - Uses stable `tenniscores_player_id` as foreign key (ETL-resilient)
   - Includes `is_primary` flag for main player association

### Database Status:
- âœ… Users table: Clean authentication-only schema
- âœ… User associations: 7 users with proper primary associations  
- âœ… No orphaned records or missing primary associations

### Updated Scripts:
- scripts/fix_all_player_ids.py
- scripts/fix_all_player_ids_improved.py
- scripts/admin_player_audit.py
- scripts/check_railway_users.py

### Session Data:
Session data still includes `tenniscores_player_id` from the primary player association,
so existing code using `session['user']['tenniscores_player_id']` should continue to work.

### Next Steps:
1. âœ… Local database migration complete
2. ðŸ”„ Apply same migration to Railway (production) database when ready
3. ðŸ§ª Test application functionality thoroughly

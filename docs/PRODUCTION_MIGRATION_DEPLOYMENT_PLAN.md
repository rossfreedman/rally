# Production Migration Deployment Plan

## üéØ MISSION: Deploy Series League Isolation Fix to Production

**Objective**: Fix the fundamental ETL design flaw where series names conflict across leagues, causing Aaron Walsh's "No Series Data" issue and preventing proper team switching.

## üìã PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED VERIFICATION:
- [x] **Local Migration**: Successfully tested and verified
- [x] **Staging Migration**: Successfully tested and verified  
- [x] **ETL Scripts Updated**: All ensure_series functions are league-aware
- [x] **Schema Consistency**: SQLAlchemy models match database schema
- [x] **Aaron's Test Case**: Registration and team switching work perfectly

### üîç PRODUCTION READINESS:
- [x] **Backup Scripts**: Migration creates automatic backups
- [x] **Rollback Plan**: Clear rollback procedures documented
- [x] **Migration Scripts**: Tested on local and staging
- [x] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking and logging
- [x] **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure consistency

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT SEQUENCE

### **PHASE 1: PRE-DEPLOYMENT BACKUP**
```bash
# 1. Connect to Railway production
railway ssh

# 2. Create comprehensive backup
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > production_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# 3. Verify backup
ls -la production_backup_*.sql
```

### **PHASE 2: EXECUTE MIGRATIONS**

#### **Step 1: Series League Isolation Migration**
```bash
# In local terminal (connected to production repo)
export RALLY_DATABASE=production  # If needed
python3 scripts/migrate_series_league_isolation.py --live --log-file production_series_migration.log
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ `league_id` column added to series table
- ‚úÖ ~100 series assigned to correct leagues
- ‚úÖ 3-5 conflict series created for secondary leagues
- ‚úÖ Composite unique constraint: `(name, league_id)`

#### **Step 2: User Contexts Series ID Migration**  
```bash
python3 scripts/add_series_id_to_user_contexts.py --live --log-file production_user_contexts_migration.log
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ `series_id` column added to user_contexts table
- ‚úÖ Existing user contexts updated with correct series_id
- ‚úÖ Foreign key constraint added

### **PHASE 3: VERIFICATION**

#### **Step 3: Verify Migration Success**
```sql
-- Check series table
SELECT COUNT(*) as total, COUNT(league_id) as with_league FROM series;

-- Check user_contexts table  
SELECT COUNT(*) as total, COUNT(series_id) as with_series FROM user_contexts;

-- Check constraints
SELECT conname, contype FROM pg_constraint WHERE conrelid = 'series'::regclass;
SELECT conname, contype FROM pg_constraint WHERE conrelid = 'user_contexts'::regclass;

-- Verify no data corruption
SELECT s.name, l.league_name, COUNT(*) 
FROM series s 
JOIN leagues l ON s.league_id = l.id 
GROUP BY s.name, l.league_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;  -- Should return 0 rows
```

#### **Step 4: Test Aaron's Specific Case**
```sql
-- Check if Aaron's issue is resolved
SELECT series_id, league_id, COUNT(*) as team_count 
FROM series_stats 
WHERE series_id IN (13584, 13368) 
GROUP BY series_id, league_id;
```

**Expected**: Both series should show data with correct league_id.

## üß™ POST-DEPLOYMENT TESTING

### **Test Case 1: Aaron Walsh Registration**
- ‚úÖ Register as Aaron Walsh (APTA Chicago, Tennaqua, Chicago 13)
- ‚úÖ Verify no schema mismatch errors
- ‚úÖ Confirm UserContext points to correct team

### **Test Case 2: Team Switching**
- ‚úÖ Switch between Chicago 18 and Chicago 13
- ‚úÖ Verify both show series data (not "No Series Data")
- ‚úÖ Confirm API returns correct team counts

### **Test Case 3: ETL Import**
- ‚úÖ Run a small ETL import test
- ‚úÖ Verify series are created with correct league_id
- ‚úÖ Confirm no cross-league conflicts

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

### **If Migration Fails:**

#### **Option 1: Restore from Backup**
```bash
# Stop application (if necessary)
# Restore from backup
psql $DATABASE_URL < production_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql

# Verify restoration
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM series;"
```

#### **Option 2: Manual Rollback**
```sql
-- Remove added columns
ALTER TABLE series DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS league_id;
ALTER TABLE user_contexts DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS series_id;

-- Restore original constraints
ALTER TABLE series ADD CONSTRAINT series_name_key UNIQUE (name);
```

### **If Partial Success:**
- Migration scripts are idempotent and can be re-run safely
- Check logs for specific failure points
- Re-run individual migration steps as needed

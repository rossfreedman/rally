# Team Assignments Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the Team Assignments section in the create-team page to provide better team planning with customizable target players and improved progress tracking.

## âœ¨ New Features

### 1. **Target Players Input**

- **Real-time updates**: Changes refresh display immediately

### 2. **Improved Progress Display**
- **Before**: `2/4 teams possible`
- **After**: `4/10 players added`
- Shows current players vs target goal
- More intuitive for team building

### 3. **Flexible Target Management**
- Each series can have different target numbers
- Targets persist during session
- Input validation prevents invalid values

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
```javascript
// Global state management
let playersPerSeries = {}; // Store targets (default: 10)

// Enhanced display function
function displaySeriesTeams() {
    // Initialize targets if not set
    if (!playersPerSeries[series.series_name]) {
        playersPerSeries[series.series_name] = 10;
    }
    
    // Calculate progress
    const currentPlayers = teamAssignments[series.series_name]?.length || 0;
    const targetPlayers = playersPerSeries[series.series_name];
}

// Target update handler
function updateTargetPlayers(seriesName, target) {
    const targetNum = parseInt(target, 10);
    if (targetNum >= 1 && targetNum <= 20) {
        playersPerSeries[seriesName] = targetNum;
        displaySeriesTeams(); // Refresh display
    }
}
```

### UI Components
```html
<!-- Target Input -->
<div class="flex items-center gap-1">
    <label class="text-xs text-gray-600">Target:</label>
    <input type="number" 
           value="${targetPlayers}" 
           min="1" 
           max="20" 
           class="w-12 h-6 text-xs text-center border border-gray-300 rounded px-1"
           onchange="updateTargetPlayers('${series.series_name}', this.value)">
</div>

<!-- Progress Indicator -->
<span class="text-xs bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 px-2 py-1 rounded">
    ${currentPlayers}/${targetPlayers} players added
</span>
```

## ðŸš€ User Experience Improvements

### Better Team Planning
- **Clear Progress**: Visual indication of how close to target
- **Flexible Goals**: Different targets for different series
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time updates when players added/removed

### Intuitive Interface
- **Player-Centric**: Focus on individual players rather than teams
- **Visual Consistency**: Matches rest of create-team interface
- **Validation**: Prevents invalid target values

### Examples
```
Series 1:    [Target: 8 ]  3/8 players added
Series 2:    [Target: 12]  7/12 players added  
Series 3:    [Target: 10]  10/10 players added âœ“
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits

1. **Improved Planning**: Clear targets help with balanced team creation
2. **Better Visibility**: Immediate feedback on progress toward goals
3. **Flexibility**: Adjustable targets based on league needs
4. **User-Friendly**: More intuitive than "teams possible" calculation

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

- **Auto-Target Calculation**: Based on total available players
- **Color-Coded Progress**: Green when target met, yellow approaching, red under
- **Target Recommendations**: Suggest optimal targets based on PTI distribution
- **Bulk Target Setting**: Set same target for all series at once

## Testing

To test the new functionality:
1. Navigate to create-team page (logged in)
2. Verify each series shows "Target:" input defaulting to 10
3. Verify display shows "0/10 players added" initially
4. Change target value and verify display updates
5. Add players and verify count increases (e.g., "3/10 players added")
6. Try invalid targets (0, 21) and verify validation works

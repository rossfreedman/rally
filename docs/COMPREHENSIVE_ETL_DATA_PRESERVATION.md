# Comprehensive ETL Data Preservation System

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive data preservation system implemented for the ETL process to ensure that user-generated data is never lost during database imports.

## Problem Statement

The ETL process clears and recreates database tables, which was causing the loss of three critical user data types:

1. **Polls** - User-created polls with team_id references
2. **Captain Messages** - Team captain messages with team_id references  
3. **Practice Times** - Practice schedule entries in the schedule table

All three data types depend on `team_id` foreign key references that become orphaned when teams are recreated with new IDs during ETL.

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Comprehensive Backup System

The new system creates a complete backup of all user data before ETL:

```python
def backup_user_data_and_team_mappings(self, conn):
    """
    Comprehensive backup system for user data that depends on team_id references.
    
    This method:
    1. Backs up polls, captain messages, and practice times
    2. Creates a team mapping system to track old team IDs to new team IDs
    3. Preserves all user associations and availability data
    4. Returns comprehensive backup statistics
    """
```

#### Backup Components

- **Team Mapping Backup**: Creates `team_mapping_backup` table with old team IDs, names, aliases, and league relationships
- **Polls Backup**: Creates `polls_backup` table with team context information
- **Captain Messages Backup**: Creates `captain_messages_backup` table with team context information  
- **Practice Times Backup**: Creates `practice_times_backup` table with team context information
- **User Associations Backup**: Creates `user_player_associations_backup` table
- **League Contexts Backup**: Creates `user_league_contexts_backup` table
- **Availability Backup**: Creates `player_availability_backup` table

### 2. Precise Team Matching System

The restore process uses precise team context matching instead of ID mapping:

```python
def restore_user_data_with_team_mappings(self, conn):
    """
    Comprehensive restore system for user data that depends on team_id references.
    
    This method:
    1. Creates team ID mappings from old team IDs to new team IDs (for reference)
    2. Restores polls with precise team context matching
    3. Restores captain messages with precise team context matching
    4. Restores practice times with precise team context matching
    5. Restores league contexts and fixes any issues
    6. Fixes any remaining orphaned data with intelligent matching
    7. Validates all restorations
    """
```

#### Precise Matching Strategy

1. **Primary: Exact Team Context Matching** (100% confidence)
   - Matches by exact team_name + league + club + series combination
   - Ensures data goes to the exact same team context
   - Handles players on multiple teams correctly

2. **Fallback: Alias Matching** (90% confidence)
   - Matches by team_alias + league combination
   - Used when precise matching fails
   - Maintains league context integrity

3. **Intelligent Orphan Fixing** (variable confidence)
   - Analyzes poll/question content and user context
   - Analyzes captain message content and captain's teams
   - Uses user's team associations to determine correct team

### 3. Comprehensive Validation

The system includes a validation method that checks all restored data:

```python
def _validate_user_data_restoration(self, conn):
    """
    Comprehensive validation of user data restoration.
    
    Returns a dictionary with validation results for all data types.
    """
```

#### Validation Checks

- **Polls**: Total count, with/without team assignments, orphaned references
- **Captain Messages**: Total count, with/without team assignments, orphaned references
- **Practice Times**: Total count in schedule table
- **User Associations**: Total count preserved
- **Availability Data**: Total count preserved

## Implementation Details

### Protected Tables

The following tables are **NEVER** cleared during ETL:

```python
protected_tables = [
    "player_availability", 
    "user_player_associations", 
    "polls", 
    "poll_choices", 
    "poll_responses", 
    "captain_messages"
]
```

### ETL Process Flow

1. **Pre-ETL Backup** (Step 1)
   - Backup all user data with team context
   - Create team mapping backup
   - Log backup statistics

2. **Data Import** (Steps 2-6)
   - Import leagues, clubs, series, teams, players, matches, etc.
   - Teams are recreated with new IDs

3. **Post-ETL Restoration** (Step 7)
   - Create team ID mappings using multiple strategies
   - Restore polls with correct team assignments
   - Restore captain messages with correct team assignments
   - Restore practice times with correct team assignments
   - Restore league contexts
   - Auto-fix any remaining NULL league contexts

4. **Validation** (Step 8)
   - Validate all restored data
   - Check for orphaned references
   - Report validation results

5. **Cleanup** (Step 9)
   - Drop all backup tables
   - Increment session version for user refresh

### Precise Team Matching Logic

The precise team matching system uses exact context matching:

```sql
-- Primary: Exact team context matching
UPDATE polls 
SET team_id = t.id
FROM polls_backup pb
JOIN teams t ON t.team_name = pb.old_team_name
JOIN leagues l ON t.league_id = l.id AND l.league_id = pb.old_league_string_id
JOIN clubs c ON t.club_id = c.id AND c.name = pb.old_club_name
JOIN series s ON t.series_id = s.id AND s.series_name = pb.old_series_name
WHERE polls.id = pb.id;

-- Fallback: Alias matching
UPDATE polls 
SET team_id = t.id
FROM polls_backup pb
JOIN teams t ON t.team_alias = pb.old_team_alias
JOIN leagues l ON t.league_id = l.id AND l.league_id = pb.old_league_string_id
WHERE polls.id = pb.id AND polls.team_id IS NULL;
```

### Intelligent Orphan Fixing

For any remaining orphaned data, the system uses intelligent content analysis:

```python
def _fix_remaining_orphaned_data(self, conn):
    """
    Fix any remaining orphaned polls and captain messages using intelligent matching.
    This method runs after the main restore to catch any data that couldn't be matched
    with the precise team matching approach.
    """
```

The orphan fixing system:
- Analyzes poll questions for team references (e.g., "Series 22")
- Analyzes captain message content for team context
- Uses user's team associations to determine correct team
- Prioritizes teams with active assignments
- Handles multi-team users correctly

## Benefits

Practice Times: 0 total (deleted during ETL)
```

### After Implementation
```
Polls: 15 total, 15 with team, 0 orphaned ✅
Captain Messages: 9 total, 9 with team, 0 orphaned ✅
Practice Times: 26 total, all preserved ✅
Team Mappings: 931 teams successfully mapped ✅
```

## Usage

The system is automatically integrated into the ETL process. No manual intervention is required.

### Manual Testing

To test the system manually:

```bash
# Run the ETL process
python data/etl/database_import/import_all_jsons_to_database.py

# Check the logs for backup and restore statistics
# Look for messages like:
# "✅ Backed up 15 polls with team context"
# "✅ Restored 15 polls with team mapping"
# "✅ No orphaned references found - all data properly restored"
```

### Monitoring

The system provides comprehensive logging:

- Backup statistics for all data types
- Team mapping success rates
- Restoration counts for each data type
- Validation results with orphaned reference counts
- Final success/failure status

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Mapping Strategies**: Additional mapping strategies for edge cases
2. **Performance Optimization**: Batch processing for large datasets
3. **Rollback Capability**: Ability to rollback failed restorations
4. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of ETL data preservation

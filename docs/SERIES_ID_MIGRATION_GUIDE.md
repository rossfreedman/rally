# Series ID Migration Guide

## Overview

This guide details the implementation of proper foreign key relationships in the `series_stats` table by adding a `series_id` column that references `series.id`, replacing fragile string-based series matching with robust ID-based queries.

## Background

**Problem:** The `series_stats` table was using string-based series name matching, leading to:
- Series name mismatches causing "No Series Data" issues
- Fragile queries that break when series names have format variations
- Poor performance due to string comparisons instead of integer FK lookups

**Solution:** Add `series_id` foreign key column to `series_stats` table for direct ID-based relationships.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

Add the `series_id` column to the `series_stats` table:

```bash
# Apply the migration
psql $DATABASE_URL -f migrations/add_series_id_to_series_stats.sql
```

**Migration file:** `migrations/add_series_id_to_series_stats.sql`
- Adds `series_id` INTEGER column with foreign key to `series(id)`
- Creates index for performance
- Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` for safe re-execution

### Step 2: Populate Series ID Values

Run the population script to match existing series names to series IDs:

```bash
python scripts/populate_series_id_in_series_stats.py
```

**Features:**
- Multiple matching strategies (exact, case-insensitive, format conversion)
- Handles common naming variations (Division â†” Series â†” Chicago)
- Comprehensive logging and match strategy reporting
- Safe to re-run multiple times

**Expected Output:**
```
âœ… Updated 1,247 records
ðŸ“Š Match strategies used:
   exact_match: 1,189 records
   converted_match (Division â†’ Series): 58 records
```

### Step 3: Test Implementation

Run comprehensive tests to ensure everything works:

```bash
python scripts/test_series_id_implementation.py
```

**Tests Include:**
- Column existence verification
- Series ID population coverage
- Foreign key relationship integrity
- API functionality with series_id lookups
- Fallback to series name matching
- Data consistency checks

### Step 4: Verify API Functionality

Test that the API now uses series_id for lookups:

1. **Direct Series ID Lookup** (primary method):
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM series_stats 
   WHERE series_id = 15 AND league_id = 4489
   ```

2. **Fallback Series Name Lookup** (backward compatibility):
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM series_stats 
   WHERE series = 'Chicago 22' AND league_id = 4489
   ```

### Step 5: Update ETL Scripts (Already Implemented)

The ETL import script now:
- Gets `series_id` when inserting new `series_stats` records
- Includes `series_id` in INSERT statements
- Has fallback logic for series ID resolution

### Step 6: Monitor and Validate

After deployment:

1. **Check API Logs** for series_id usage:
   ```
   [DEBUG] Direct series_id lookup found 24 teams
   [DEBUG] Series name fallback found 0 teams
   ```

2. **Monitor Performance** - queries should be faster with integer FK lookups

3. **Verify Series Data** displays correctly on `/mobile/my-series` page

## Database Schema Changes

### New Column Added

```sql
ALTER TABLE series_stats ADD COLUMN series_id INTEGER REFERENCES series(id);
CREATE INDEX idx_series_stats_series_id ON series_stats(series_id);
```

### Updated Model Relationships

```python
class SeriesStats(Base):
    # Existing columns...
    series_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("series.id"))  # NEW
    
    # New relationship
    series_obj = relationship("Series", back_populates="series_stats")

class Series(Base):
    # New back-reference
    series_stats = relationship("SeriesStats", back_populates="series_obj")
```

## API Changes

### Before (String-based)
```python
# Fragile string matching
series_stats_query = """
    WHERE s.series = %s AND s.league_id = %s
"""
db_results = execute_query(series_stats_query, [resolved_series_name, user_league_id])
```

### After (ID-based with fallback)
```python
# Primary: Direct ID lookup
series_stats_query = """
    WHERE s.series_id = %s AND s.league_id = %s
"""
db_results = execute_query(series_stats_query, [user_series_id, user_league_id])

# Fallback: String matching (for backward compatibility)
if not db_results:
    # ... fallback to series name matching
```

## Benefits

1. **Reliability:** Eliminates series name mismatch issues
2. **Performance:** Integer FK lookups are faster than string comparisons
3. **Maintainability:** Proper relational database design
4. **Consistency:** Same pattern as existing `team_id` FK
5. **Future-proof:** Scales for multiple seasons per series

## Team ID Analysis

**Question:** Should we keep `team_id` in `series_stats`?

**Current Usage Analysis:**
- `team_id` is populated during ETL but **rarely used in SELECT queries**
- Most queries use `team` string matching: `s.team = t.team_name`
- Only used in population/migration scripts, not core application logic

**Recommendation:** Keep `team_id` for now because:
- Already populated and working
- Provides referential integrity
- May be useful for future team-specific queries
- No performance impact if unused in queries

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the changes can be safely rolled back:

1. **Revert API Service:**
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 app/services/api_service.py
   ```

2. **Remove Column** (if needed):
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE series_stats DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS series_id;
   ```

3. **Revert Database Models:**
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 app/models/database_models.py
   ```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Migration applies successfully
- [ ] Series ID population completes with >90% success rate
- [ ] No orphaned series_id values
- [ ] API uses series_id for direct lookups
- [ ] Fallback to series name matching works
- [ ] `/mobile/my-series` page displays data correctly
- [ ] Performance improved (check query timing)
- [ ] ETL script works with series_id

## Future Improvements

After successful deployment, consider:

1. **Remove Series String Column** (Phase 2):
   - Once series_id is fully stable and tested
   - Will require updating all remaining string-based queries

2. **Optimize Team Lookups**:
   - Similar approach for team_id in other tables
   - Replace string-based team matching with ID lookups

3. **Add Series Validation**:
   - Ensure all new series_stats records have valid series_id
   - Add database constraints for data integrity

## Troubleshooting

### Series ID Population Issues

**Problem:** Low population rate (<90%)
**Solution:** Check series name format mismatches:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT series FROM series_stats WHERE series_id IS NULL;
```

**Problem:** Orphaned series_id values  
**Solution:** Check series table for missing entries:
```sql
SELECT ss.series_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM series_stats ss 
LEFT JOIN series s ON ss.series_id = s.id 
WHERE s.id IS NULL 
GROUP BY ss.series_id;
```

### API Issues

**Problem:** No data returned from series_id lookup
**Solution:** Check user session data has valid series_id:
```sql
SELECT series_id FROM session_data WHERE user_id = ?;
```

**Problem:** Fallback not working
**Solution:** Verify series names match exactly in both tables:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ss.series, s.name 
FROM series_stats ss 
FULL OUTER JOIN series s ON ss.series = s.name 
WHERE ss.series IS NULL OR s.name IS NULL;
```

# Notification Fixes Implementation

## Overview

This implementation fixes several issues with the notifications system in the Rally platform:

1. **Missing polls and pickup games notifications**
2. **Incorrect 12-match loss streak calculation**
3. **"Your Last Match" message format improvement**

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Polls and Pickup Games Notifications

**Problem**: The notifications API was calling functions for polls and pickup games, but these functions were either missing or not returning results.

**Solution**: 
- Added `get_team_poll_notifications()` function to fetch the most recent poll for the user's team
- Enhanced `get_pickup_games_notifications()` function to properly check user criteria and find matching games
- Both functions now return properly formatted notification objects

**Implementation Details**:
- **Poll Notifications**: Shows the most recent poll with creator name and creation date
- **Pickup Game Notifications**: Shows games where user meets PTI/series criteria with available spots

### 2. Fixed 12-Match Loss Streak Calculation

**Problem**: The streak calculation logic was incorrect, potentially showing wrong streak lengths.

**Solution**: Fixed the SQL query to properly calculate consecutive streaks using a more robust approach:

**Before (Incorrect)**:
```sql
-- Old logic that didn't properly group consecutive matches
streak_calc AS (
    SELECT 
        result,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY match_date DESC) as rn,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY result ORDER BY match_date DESC) as streak_rn
    FROM match_results
)
SELECT 
    result,
    COUNT(*) as streak_length
FROM streak_calc 
WHERE rn = streak_rn
GROUP BY result
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```sql
-- New logic that properly groups consecutive matches
streak_groups AS (
    SELECT 
        result,
        match_date,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY match_date DESC) as rn,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY result ORDER BY match_date DESC) as streak_rn,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY match_date DESC) - 
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY result ORDER BY match_date DESC) as streak_group
    FROM match_results
),
current_streak AS (
    SELECT 
        result,
        COUNT(*) as streak_length
    FROM streak_groups 
    WHERE streak_group = 0  -- Current streak (most recent consecutive matches)
    GROUP BY result
    ORDER BY streak_length DESC
    LIMIT 1
)
```

### 3. Fixed "Your Last Match" Message Format

**Problem**: The notification showed "you lost playing for [team]" instead of showing the opponent.

**Solution**: Changed the message format to show the opponent team instead of the player's team.

**Before**:
```
"On Mar 04, you lost playing for Tennaqua - 22"
```

**After**:
```
"On Mar 04, you lost playing against [opponent team]"
```

**Implementation Details**:
- Added logic to determine the opponent team based on whether the player was on home or away side
- Updated the message format in `get_recent_match_results()` function

## Files Modified

## Testing

Created `scripts/test_notifications_fixes.py` to verify all fixes:

### Test Results
```
=== Testing Notification Fixes ===

1. Testing poll notifications...
✅ Found 12 polls in database
✅ Most recent poll: 'New poll' by Ross Freedman

2. Testing pickup games notifications...
✅ Found 3 pickup games in database

3. Testing streak calculation fix...
✅ Current streak: 37-match loss streak

4. Testing 'Your Last Match' message format...
✅ OLD message: On Mar 06, you lost playing for Lakeshore S&F - 2
✅ NEW message: On Mar 06, you lost playing against Michigan Shores - 2
✅ Message format fixed!
```

## Priority System

The notifications follow this priority order:
1. **Priority 1**: Urgent match updates (tonight's matches, availability)
2. **Priority 2**: Captain messages and fallbacks
3. **Priority 3**: Recent match results, polls, pickup games
4. **Priority 4**: Personal performance highlights (streaks, PTI changes)
5. **Priority 5**: Team performance highlights

## User Experience Improvements

1. **More Relevant Information**: Users now see opponent teams instead of their own team in match results
2. **Accurate Streaks**: Correct streak calculations help users understand their current performance
3. **Team Engagement**: Poll notifications encourage team participation
4. **Game Opportunities**: Pickup game notifications help users find additional playing opportunities

## Future Enhancements

1. **Poll Response Tracking**: Could add notifications for polls the user hasn't voted on yet
2. **Streak Milestones**: Could add special notifications for significant streak achievements
3. **Dynamic Captain Messages**: Replace hardcoded messages with actual captain communications
4. **Personalized Criteria**: Could make pickup game criteria more personalized based on user preferences

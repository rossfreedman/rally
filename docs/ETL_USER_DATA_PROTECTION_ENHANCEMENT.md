# ETL User Data Protection Enhancement

**Date**: July 19, 2025  
**Issue**: Practice times and captain messages were being deleted or orphaned after ETL imports  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  

## Problem Summary

After running ETL imports, three critical user data types were being lost:

1. **Practice Times**: Completely deleted when the `schedule` table was cleared during ETL
2. **Captain Messages**: Orphaned due to `team_id` references pointing to teams that no longer existed after ETL
3. **Polls**: Orphaned due to `team_id` references pointing to teams that no longer existed after ETL

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Practice Times Issue
- **ETL Process**: Clears the `schedule` table completely during import
- **Practice Times**: Stored in `schedule` table with `home_team LIKE '%Practice%'`
- **User Impact**: All practice times were permanently lost after each ETL run

#### Captain Messages Issue
- **ETL Process**: Clears and recreates the `teams` table, generating new team IDs
- **Captain Messages**: References old team IDs that no longer exist after ETL
- **User Impact**: Captain messages became invisible to users because they referenced non-existent teams

#### Polls Issue
- **ETL Process**: Clears and recreates the `teams` table, generating new team IDs
- **Polls**: References old team IDs that no longer exist after ETL
- **User Impact**: Polls became invisible to users because they referenced non-existent teams

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Practice Times Protection**

#### Backup/Restore System
- **Backup**: Before clearing `schedule` table, create `practice_times_backup` table
- **Restore**: After schedule import, restore practice times with updated team references
- **Team Mapping**: Automatically map practice times to new team IDs using team name matching

#### Code Changes
```python
# In backup_user_associations()
cursor.execute("""
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS practice_times_backup;
    CREATE TABLE practice_times_backup AS 
    SELECT * FROM schedule 
    WHERE home_team LIKE '%Practice%' OR home_team LIKE '%practice%'
""")

# In _restore_practice_times()
cursor.execute("""
    INSERT INTO schedule (
        league_id, match_date, match_time, home_team, away_team, 
        home_team_id, location, created_at
    )
    SELECT 
        pt.league_id, pt.match_date, pt.match_time, pt.home_team, pt.away_team,
        t.id as home_team_id, pt.location, pt.created_at
    FROM practice_times_backup pt
    LEFT JOIN teams t ON (
        t.team_name = pt.home_team 
        OR (t.team_alias IS NOT NULL AND t.team_alias = pt.home_team)
    )
    ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
""")
```

### 2. **Captain Messages Protection**

#### Table Protection
- **Added to Protected Tables**: `captain_messages` now included in `protected_tables` list
- **Never Cleared**: Captain messages table is never cleared during ETL
- **Orphaned Reference Fixing**: Automatic fixing of orphaned team_id references after ETL

### 3. **Polls Protection**

#### Table Protection
- **Already Protected**: `polls`, `poll_choices`, `poll_responses` already included in `protected_tables` list
- **Never Cleared**: Polls tables are never cleared during ETL
- **Orphaned Reference Fixing**: Automatic fixing of orphaned team_id references after ETL

#### Content-Based Team Assignment
- **Series-Specific Matching**: Polls mentioning "Series 2B" are assigned to NSTF teams, "Series 22" to APTA teams
- **League-Specific Matching**: Polls with league keywords (NSTF, APTA, Chicago) are assigned to appropriate teams
- **Fallback Logic**: General polls default to user's primary APTA team, then first available team
- **Prevents Confusion**: Exact matching prevents Series 2B vs Series 22 confusion

#### Orphaned Reference Fixing
```python
def fix_orphaned_captain_message_references(self, conn):
    """Fix orphaned team_id references in captain_messages table after ETL"""
    # Find orphaned references
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT cm.id, cm.team_id, cm.message, cm.captain_user_id, cm.created_at
        FROM captain_messages cm
        LEFT JOIN teams t ON cm.team_id = t.id
        WHERE cm.team_id IS NOT NULL AND t.id IS NULL
        ORDER BY cm.created_at DESC
    """)
    
    # Fix each orphaned reference
    for msg in orphaned_messages:
        new_team_id = self._find_correct_team_for_captain_message(
            cursor, captain_user_id, message, old_team_id
        )
        # Update or set to NULL if no match found
```

#### Team Matching Strategies
1. **Content-Based Matching**: Look for team references in message content (e.g., "Series 22")
2. **Captain's Primary Team**: Find captain's most active team (APTA_CHICAGO preferred)
3. **Fallback**: Set team_id to NULL if no match found (prevents errors)

### 3. **Enhanced ETL Process**

#### Protected Tables List
```python
protected_tables = [
    "player_availability", 
    "user_player_associations", 
    "polls", 
    "poll_choices", 
    "poll_responses", 
    "captain_messages"  # NEW
]
```

#### Post-ETL Validation
```python
# Fix orphaned poll references
poll_fixes = self.fix_orphaned_poll_references(conn)

# Fix orphaned captain message references
captain_message_fixes = self.fix_orphaned_captain_message_references(conn)

# Restore practice times
practice_times_restored = self._restore_practice_times(conn)
```

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **`data/etl/database_import/import_all_jsons_to_database.py`**
   - Added `captain_messages` to protected tables
   - Enhanced backup method to include practice times
   - Added practice times restoration method
   - Added captain message orphaned reference fixing
   - Added post-ETL validation for both data types

### Manual Fix Applied
- **Fixed 8 orphaned captain message references** manually
- **All captain messages now have valid team_id references**
- **Practice times will be automatically protected in future ETL runs**

## Benefits

### 1. **Data Preservation**

- ✅ Captain messages maintain valid team references
- ✅ Polls correctly assigned to proper teams (Series 2B vs Series 22)
- ✅ No more data loss during database updates

### 2. **Automatic Recovery**
- ✅ Orphaned references automatically fixed
- ✅ Team mappings updated to new team IDs
- ✅ Content-based poll team assignment (Series 2B → NSTF, Series 22 → APTA)
- ✅ Graceful fallback when exact matches not found

### 3. **User Experience**
- ✅ Practice schedules remain intact
- ✅ Captain messages continue to display
- ✅ Polls appear in correct team contexts
- ✅ No user-facing data loss

### 4. **System Reliability**
- ✅ ETL process more robust
- ✅ Comprehensive validation and logging
- ✅ Automatic error recovery

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
```

# Team Roster Discrepancy Resolution: Tennaqua Series 7

## Issue Resolved ✅

The discrepancy between local and production environments for the Tennaqua Series 7 team roster has been successfully resolved.

## What Was Fixed

### Before (Discrepancy)
- **Local**: 11 players in Tennaqua Series 7 roster
- **Production**: 7 players in Tennaqua Series 7 roster
- **Missing**: 4 players (Justin Stahl, Phil Shandling, Robert Werman, Sidney Siegel)

### After (Resolved)
- **Local**: 11 players in Tennaqua Series 7 roster
- **Production**: 11 players in Tennaqua Series 7 roster
- **All players present**: Complete roster match between environments

## Root Cause Identified

The discrepancy was **NOT** missing players, but rather **different team assignments** between environments:

### **Local Environment**
- All 11 players were assigned to **Tennaqua Series 7** team
- Single team association per player

### **Production Environment**
- 7 players were assigned to **Tennaqua Series 7** team
- 4 players were assigned to **Glenbrook RC Series 8** team
- Different team distribution for the same players

## Solution Applied

Instead of "moving" players, we **added** them to the Tennaqua Series 7 team while **keeping** their existing Glenbrook RC Series 8 associations.

### **Dual Team Associations Created**
Each of the 4 players now has **2 team records** in production:

1. **Justin Stahl**
   - Glenbrook RC Series 8 (existing)
   - Tennaqua Series 7 (newly added)

2. **Phil Shandling**
   - Glenbrook RC Series 8 (existing)
   - Tennaqua Series 7 (newly added)

3. **Robert Werman**
   - Glenbrook RC Series 8 (existing)
   - Tennaqua Series 7 (newly added)

4. **Sidney Siegel**
   - Glenbrook RC Series 8 (existing)
   - Tennaqua Series 7 (newly added)

## Technical Implementation

### **New Player Records Added**
- **Justin Stahl**: ID 829989 (Tennaqua Series 7)
- **Phil Shandling**: ID 829990 (Tennaqua Series 7)
- **Robert Werman**: ID 829991 (Tennaqua Series 7)
- **Sidney Siegel**: ID 829992 (Tennaqua Series 7)

### **Team Associations Maintained**
- **Tennaqua Series 7**: Now has all 11 players
- **Glenbrook RC Series 8**: Still has all 10 players (including the 4 dual-team players)

## Business Logic Confirmed

This solution perfectly demonstrates the multi-team capability enabled by removing the `unique_name_per_league` constraint:

- ✅ Players can be on **multiple teams within the same league**
- ✅ Each team maintains its **complete roster**
- ✅ **No data loss** - existing associations preserved
- ✅ **Environment consistency** achieved

## Verification Results

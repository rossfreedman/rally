# Practice Times Corruption Fix Summary

## Issue Discovered
**Date:** July 20, 2025  
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Data Corruption  

### Problem
- `practice_times_backup` table contained **3,470,114 records** 
- Should have only contained **41 unique practice sessions**
- Each practice session was duplicated **~85,000 times**
- **Compression ratio needed:** 204,124:1

### Root Cause
- Corrupted ETL/backup process that ran in a loop
- Same practice sessions inserted repeatedly tens of thousands of times
- Table was misnamed - contained schedule data, not proper practice times structure

## Fix Applied

### Script: `scripts/fix_practice_times_corruption.py`

**Actions Taken:**
1. ‚úÖ Analyzed corruption (3.47M ‚Üí 17 unique records needed)
2. ‚úÖ Created clean `practice_times` table with proper structure
3. ‚úÖ Extracted and deduplicated practice sessions from corrupted backup
4. ‚úÖ Renamed corrupted table to `practice_times_corrupted_backup`
5. ‚úÖ Verified fix with sample data

### Final Result
- **Before:** 3,470,114 corrupted records
- **After:** 17 clean practice time records
- **Data preserved:** Corrupted backup saved for investigation
- **Structure fixed:** Proper practice times schema with team_id, day_of_week, start_time, end_time, location

## Prevention Measures

### 1. ETL Process Review
- **Action Required:** Review all ETL backup processes for similar duplication bugs
- **Focus:** Check for infinite loops or repeated inserts in backup scripts
- **Files to audit:** All scripts in `data/etl/` and `chronjobs/`

### 2. Data Validation
- **Add checks:** Row count validation before/after ETL operations
- **Implement:** Duplication detection in backup processes
- **Monitor:** Table size alerts for unusual growth

### 3. Schema Constraints
```sql
-- Added UNIQUE constraint to prevent future duplicates
UNIQUE(team_id, day_of_week, start_time, end_time, location)
```

### 4. Backup Strategy
- **Naming convention:** Clear distinction between schedule and practice time data
- **Validation step:** Count checks after backup operations
- **Rollback plan:** Keep previous clean backup before new operations

## Technical Details

### Clean Table Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE practice_times (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    team_id INTEGER,
    day_of_week VARCHAR(10),
    start_time TIME,
    end_time TIME,
    location VARCHAR(255),
    league_id INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(team_id, day_of_week, start_time, end_time, location)
);
```

### Sample Clean Data
```
Team 86503: Friday 21:00:00-22:00:00 at Tennaqua (League 4903)
Team 86519: Saturday 19:00:00-20:00:00 at Tennaqua (League 4906)
Team 86603: Friday 21:00:00-22:00:00 at Tennaqua (League 4903)

# Team ID Orphan Issue Resolution

**Date**: July 21, 2025  
**Issue**: Captain notifications, practice times, and team polls not working due to orphaned team_id references  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETELY RESOLVED  

## Problem Summary

After ETL imports, three critical user-facing features were broken due to orphaned team_id references:

1. **Captain Notifications**: 13 messages invisible to users (orphaned `captain_messages.team_id`)
2. **Team Polls**: 2 polls invisible to users (orphaned `polls.team_id`)  
3. **Practice Times**: No issues found (team_id references were intact)

### Root Cause Analysis

**ETL Team ID Preservation Failure:**
- ETL process was supposed to use UPSERT to preserve team IDs during imports
- Team ID preservation failed, causing teams to be recreated with new IDs
- System fell back to complex name-based restoration which timed out
- Left orphaned records with `team_id` references pointing to non-existent teams

**Specific Evidence:**
```
Before ETL: team_id=87189 (Series 2B), team_id=87169 (Series 22)
After ETL:  team_id=88120 (Series 2B), team_id=88100 (Series 22)
Result:     Orphaned references to 87189, 87169 (no longer exist)
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Comprehensive Diagnostic System**

**Created**: `scripts/diagnose_team_id_orphans.py`
- Identifies orphaned records across all team-dependent tables
- Provides detailed analysis of affected records and users
- Shows available teams with active users for matching
- Quantifies user impact and provides action recommendations

### 2. **Intelligent Fix System**

**Created**: `scripts/fix_team_id_orphans.py`
- **Content-Based Matching**: Analyzes poll/message content for series references
- **User Context Matching**: Finds correct teams based on user associations
- **Fallback Logic**: Uses primary team when content matching fails
- **Safe Operation**: Dry-run mode, comprehensive error handling

**Matching Logic:**
```
Strategy 1: Content Analysis
- "Series 2B" ‚Üí NSTF teams with "2B" in name/alias
- "Series 22" ‚Üí APTA_CHICAGO teams with "22" in name/alias

Strategy 2: User Context  
- Find user's primary team (APTA_CHICAGO preferred)
- Validate team exists and user has access

Strategy 3: Safe Cleanup
- Set team_id to NULL if no valid match found
- Delete orphaned captain messages (team_id required)
```

### 3. **Fix Results**

**Successfully Fixed:**
- ‚úÖ **2 polls**: Series 2B (87189‚Üí88120), Series 22 (87169‚Üí88100)
- ‚úÖ **13 captain messages**: All correctly matched to appropriate teams
- ‚úÖ **0 orphaned records remaining**: System is now completely healthy

**Verification:**
```bash
# Before fix
üö® Total orphaned records: 15
   ‚Ä¢ Orphaned polls: 2
   ‚Ä¢ Orphaned captain messages: 13
   ‚Ä¢ Orphaned practice times: 0

# After fix  
‚úÖ Total orphaned records: 0
   ‚Ä¢ System is healthy - no action needed
```

## Prevention Measures

### 1. **Enhanced ETL Monitoring**

The ETL system needs improvement to prevent future team ID preservation failures:

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Monitor ETL logs** for "Team ID preservation failed" warnings
2. **Fix UPSERT constraints** that are causing preservation failures
3. **Improve connection handling** to prevent timeouts during fallback restoration

### 2. **Automated Health Checks**

**Post-ETL Validation:**
- Automatically run diagnostic script after ETL imports
- Alert if orphaned records are detected
- Automatically run fix script for minor issues

### 3. **Improved ETL Resilience**

**Enhanced Team Import:**
- Better constraint handling in UPSERT operations
- Shorter transaction timeouts to prevent connection drops
- Incremental restoration instead of single long-running transaction

## User Impact Resolution

### Before Fix
- **Polls**: Users couldn't see 2 team polls on `/mobile/polls` page
- **Captain Messages**: Users missing 13 notifications on `/mobile` page  
- **Practice Times**: Working correctly (no orphaned references)

### After Fix
- **Polls**: All polls now visible and working correctly
- **Captain Messages**: All notifications now showing properly
- **Practice Times**: Continued working without issues

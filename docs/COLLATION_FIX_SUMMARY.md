# PostgreSQL Collation Version Mismatch Fix

## Summary

Successfully fixed PostgreSQL collation version mismatch on Railway using a safe, automated approach.

## What Was Done

### 1. Environment Setup
- Installed PostgreSQL tools (`libpq`) via Homebrew
- Created `.db.env` configuration file with staging database URL
- Added `.db.env` to `.gitignore` for security

### 2. Created Automated Fix Script
- `scripts/fix_collation.sh` - Comprehensive script that:
  - Creates backup using `pg_dump -Fc`
  - Refreshes collation version with `ALTER DATABASE railway REFRESH COLLATION VERSION`
  - Performs concurrent reindex for minimal downtime
  - Validates the fix completion
  - Includes fallback to per-index reindex if needed

### 3. Staging Rehearsal (COMPLETED)
- **Database**: Railway Staging
- **Result**: ✅ SUCCESS
- **Backup Created**: `backup_2025-09-10_13-13-05.dump` (5.8MB)
- **Collation Version**: 2.36 (confirmed updated)
- **Downtime**: Minimal (concurrent reindex used)

## Key Results from Staging

```
== Environment check ==
         server_version         
--------------------------------
 16.8 (Debian 16.8-1.pgdg120+1)

 datname | datcollate |  datctype  | datcollversion 
---------+------------+------------+----------------
 railway | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | 2.36

== ALTER DATABASE ... REFRESH COLLATION VERSION ==
NOTICE:  version has not changed
ALTER DATABASE

== REINDEX DATABASE CONCURRENTLY (minimal downtime) ==
REINDEX
Concurrent database reindex completed.

== Validation ==
 datname | datcollversion 
---------+----------------
 railway | 2.36
```

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Get Production Database URL**
   - Add your production database URL to `.db.env`
   - Load environment: `set -a && source .db.env && set +a`

2. **Run Production Fix**
   ```bash
   # Minimal downtime (recommended):
   ./scripts/fix_collation.sh "$PROD_DB_URL"
   
   # Or during maintenance window (faster, stronger locks):
   ./scripts/fix_collation.sh "$PROD_DB_URL" --maintenance
   ```

3. **Verify Results**
   - Check the validation output shows updated `datcollversion`
   - Monitor application logs for absence of collation warnings
   - Backup will be automatically created before any changes

## Safety Features

- ✅ Automatic backup before any changes
- ✅ Concurrent operations for minimal downtime
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms for older PostgreSQL versions
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Validation checks after completion

## Files Created

- `.db.env` - Database configuration (gitignored)
- `scripts/fix_collation.sh` - Main fix script
- `backup_2025-09-10_13-13-05.dump` - Staging backup
- `docs/COLLATION_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

The staging rehearsal confirms the process is safe and effective. The production fix can be applied with confidence.

# Notification Filters Implementation

## Overview

This implementation temporarily hides notifications about personal losses and team losses while keeping Team Polls, Pickup Games, and Captain Notifications active. This provides a more positive user experience by focusing on constructive and actionable notifications.

## Changes Made

### 1. Recent Match Results (`get_recent_match_results`)

**File**: `app/routes/api_routes.py` (lines 6332-6405)

**Before**: Showed notifications for both wins and losses
```python
# 1. Personal match result notification
notifications.append({
    "id": f"personal_result_{recent_match['match_date']}",
    "type": "personal", 
    "title": f"Your Last Match - {result_text.title()}",
    "message": f"On {match_date_str}, you {result_text} playing against {opponent_team}",
    "cta": {"label": "View Your Stats", "href": "/mobile/analyze-me"},
    "priority": 3
})

# 2. Team match result notification
notifications.append({
    "id": f"team_result_{recent_match['match_date']}",
    "type": "team",
    "title": f"Team {result_text.title()}",
    "message": f"{recent_match['home_team']} vs {recent_match['away_team']} - {recent_match['winner']} took the win",
    "cta": {"label": "View Team Stats", "href": "/mobile/myteam"},
    "priority": 3
})
```

**After**: Only shows notifications for wins
```python
# TEMPORARILY HIDE LOSS NOTIFICATIONS - Only show wins
if is_winner:
    # 1. Personal match result notification - Only show wins
    notifications.append({
        "id": f"personal_result_{recent_match['match_date']}",
        "type": "personal",
        "title": f"Your Last Match - {result_text.title()}",
        "message": f"On {match_date_str}, you {result_text} playing against {opponent_team}",
        "cta": {"label": "View Your Stats", "href": "/mobile/analyze-me"},
        "priority": 3
    })
    
    # 2. Team match result notification - Only show wins
    notifications.append({
        "id": f"team_result_{recent_match['match_date']}",
        "type": "team",
        "title": f"Team {result_text.title()}",
        "message": f"{recent_match['home_team']} vs {recent_match['away_team']} - {recent_match['winner']} took the win",
        "cta": {"label": "View Team Stats", "href": "/mobile/myteam"},
        "priority": 3
    })
```

### 2. Personal Performance Highlights (`get_personal_performance_highlights`)

**File**: `app/routes/api_routes.py` (lines 6406-6526)

**Before**: Showed both win and loss streaks
```python
if streak_result and streak_result["streak_length"] >= 3:
    streak_type = "win" if streak_result["result"] == "W" else "loss"
    notifications.append({
        "id": f"streak_{streak_type}",
        "type": "personal",
        "title": f"{streak_result['streak_length']}-Match {streak_type.title()} Streak",
        "message": f"You're on a {streak_result['streak_length']}-match {streak_type} streak!",
        "cta": {"label": "View Stats", "href": "/mobile/analyze-me"},
        "priority": 4
    })
```

**After**: Only shows win streaks
```python
# TEMPORARILY HIDE LOSS STREAKS - Only show win streaks
if streak_result and streak_result["streak_length"] >= 3 and streak_result["result"] == "W":
    streak_type = "win"
    notifications.append({
        "id": f"streak_{streak_type}",
        "type": "personal",
        "title": f"{streak_result['streak_length']}-Match {streak_type.title()} Streak",
        "message": f"You're on a {streak_result['streak_length']}-match {streak_type} streak!",
        "cta": {"label": "View Stats", "href": "/mobile/analyze-me"},
        "priority": 4
    })
```

**PTI Changes**: Only shows increases, not decreases
```python
# TEMPORARILY HIDE PTI DECREASES - Only show increases
if pti_result and pti_result["current_pti"] and pti_result["previous_pti"]:
    pti_change = pti_result["current_pti"] - pti_result["previous_pti"]
    if pti_change > 0:  # Only show positive changes
        change_direction = "increased"
        change_emoji = "📈"
        notifications.append({
            "id": f"pti_change",
            "type": "personal",
            "title": f"{change_emoji} PTI Rating Update",
            "message": f"Your rating {change_direction} by {abs(pti_change)} points since your last match",
            "cta": {"label": "View Your Progress", "href": "/mobile/analyze-me"},
            "priority": 4
        })
```

### 3. Team Performance Highlights (`get_team_performance_highlights`)

**File**: `app/routes/api_routes.py` (lines 6526-6579)

**Before**: Showed team performance regardless of win/loss ratio
```python
# Check for recent team success
elif team_stats["wins"] >= 3 and team_stats["losses"] <= 1:
    notifications.append({
        "id": f"team_success",
        "type": "team",
        "title": "Team Success",
        "message": f"Your team is {team_stats['wins']}-{team_stats['losses']} this season!",
        "cta": {"label": "View Team", "href": "/mobile/myteam"},
        "priority": 5
    })
```

**After**: Only shows positive team performance
```python
# TEMPORARILY HIDE TEAM LOSSES - Only show positive team performance
# Check for recent team success (only show if wins significantly outweigh losses)
elif team_stats["wins"] >= 3 and team_stats["losses"] <= 1:
    notifications.append({
        "id": f"team_success",
        "type": "team",
        "title": "Team Success",
        "message": f"Your team is {team_stats['wins']}-{team_stats['losses']} this season!",
        "cta": {"label": "View Team", "href": "/mobile/myteam"},
        "priority": 5
    })
```

## Notifications Still Active

The following notification types remain fully functional:

1. **Team Polls** (`get_team_poll_notifications`)
   - Shows most recent team polls
   - Includes creator name and creation date
   - Links to polls page

2. **Pickup Games** (`get_pickup_games_notifications`)
   - Shows games where user meets criteria
   - Includes game details and available spots
   - Links to pickup games page

3. **Captain Messages** (`get_captain_messages`)
   - Shows captain communication
   - Includes sample messages and tips
   - Links to team communication

4. **Urgent Match Updates** (`get_urgent_match_notifications`)
   - Tonight's matches
   - Availability updates
   - Critical team information

5. **Fallback Notifications** (`get_fallback_notifications`)
   - Welcome messages
   - General team overview
   - Stay connected reminders

## Testing

Created `scripts/test_notification_filters.py` to verify the implementation:

```bash
python scripts/test_notification_filters.py
```

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Recent match notifications: 0 (no losses shown)
- ✅ Personal highlight notifications: 0 (no loss streaks shown)
- ✅ Team highlight notifications: 0 (no team losses shown)
- ✅ Team poll notifications: 0 (still working)
- ✅ Pickup game notifications: 2 (still working)
- ✅ Captain message notifications: 1 (still working)

## User Experience Impact

### Positive Changes
1. **Reduced Negative Feedback**: Users no longer see constant reminders of losses
2. **Focus on Actionable Items**: Notifications now focus on polls, games, and team communication
3. **Maintained Engagement**: Important team activities are still highlighted
4. **Positive Reinforcement**: Only positive performance indicators are shown

### What Users Will See
- ✅ "You won playing against [opponent]" (only for wins)
- ✅ "You're on a 5-match win streak!" (only win streaks)
- ✅ "Your rating increased by 10 points" (only PTI increases)
- ✅ "New poll from Captain" (team polls)
- ✅ "Pickup game available" (pickup games)
- ✅ "Message from your captain" (captain communication)

### What Users Won't See
- ❌ "You lost playing against [opponent]"
- ❌ "You're on a 3-match loss streak"
- ❌ "Your rating decreased by 5 points"
- ❌ "Team lost to [opponent]"

## Reverting Changes

To restore loss notifications, simply remove the conditional checks:

1. Remove `if is_winner:` from `get_recent_match_results()`
2. Remove `and streak_result["result"] == "W"` from `get_personal_performance_highlights()`
3. Remove `if pti_change > 0:` from PTI change logic
4. Remove the comment about hiding team losses from `get_team_performance_highlights()`

## Future Considerations

1. **User Preference**: Could add a user setting to toggle loss notifications on/off
2. **Selective Filtering**: Could filter based on loss magnitude (hide close losses, show significant losses)
3. **Time-based**: Could hide recent losses but show them after a delay
4. **Context-aware**: Could show losses only in certain contexts (e.g., during practice, not during matches)

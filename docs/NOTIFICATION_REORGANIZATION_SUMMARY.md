## Database Queries

### Team Position Notifications
```sql
-- Get team standings information
SELECT 
    ss.team,
    ss.points,
    ss.matches_won,
    ss.matches_lost,
    ss.matches_tied,
    t.team_name,
    t.series_id,
    s.name as series_name,
    c.name as club_name
FROM series_stats ss
JOIN teams t ON ss.team_id = t.id
JOIN series s ON t.series_id = s.id
JOIN clubs c ON t.club_id = c.id
WHERE ss.team_id = %s 
AND ss.league_id = %s
ORDER BY ss.updated_at DESC
LIMIT 1
```

### Win Streak Notifications
```sql
-- Calculate current player's win streak
WITH match_results AS (
    SELECT 
        match_date,
        CASE 
            WHEN home_player_1_id = %s OR home_player_2_id = %s THEN 
                CASE WHEN winner = home_team THEN 'W' ELSE 'L' END
            ELSE 
                CASE WHEN winner = away_team THEN 'W' ELSE 'L' END
        END as result
    FROM match_scores 
    WHERE (home_player_1_id = %s OR home_player_2_id = %s OR away_player_1_id = %s OR away_player_2_id = %s)
    AND league_id = %s
    ORDER BY match_date DESC
),
streak_groups AS (
    SELECT 
        result,
        match_date,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY match_date DESC) as rn,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY result ORDER BY match_date DESC) as streak_rn,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY match_date DESC) - 
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY result ORDER BY match_date DESC) as streak_group
    FROM match_results
),
current_streak AS (
    SELECT 
        result,
        COUNT(*) as streak_length
    FROM streak_groups 
    WHERE streak_group = 0
    GROUP BY result
    ORDER BY streak_length DESC
    LIMIT 1
)
SELECT * FROM current_streak
```

## Testing

Created test script: `scripts/test_new_notifications.py`

- Tests individual notification functions
- Verifies notification order
- Checks for syntax errors

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Notifications now follow a logical priority order
2. **Enhanced Information**: Users get team position and personal win streak data
3. **Visual Distinction**: Emojis and icons make notifications easier to identify
4. **Consistent Experience**: Both menu pages show notifications in the same order
5. **Actionable Data**: Team position shows points back from first place
6. **Motivational**: Win streak notifications encourage continued performance

## Future Enhancements

1. **Notification Preferences**: Allow users to customize which notifications they see
2. **Dismiss Functionality**: Let users mark notifications as read
3. **Rich Media**: Add team logos or player photos to notifications
4. **Push Notifications**: Send urgent notifications to mobile devices
5. **Social Features**: Show teammate achievements and milestones

## Technical Implementation

### Database Queries

#### Practices Query
```sql
SELECT 
    pt.id, pt.team_id, pt.day_of_week, pt.start_time, pt.end_time,
    pt.location, pt.league_id, t.team_name, c.name as club_name, l.league_name
FROM practice_times pt
JOIN teams t ON pt.team_id = t.id
JOIN clubs c ON t.club_id = c.id
JOIN leagues l ON t.league_id = l.id
WHERE pt.team_id IN ({team_ids})
ORDER BY pt.day_of_week, pt.start_time
```

#### Matches Query
```sql
SELECT 
    s.id, s.match_date, s.match_time, s.location, s.league_id,
    s.home_team_id, s.away_team_id, s.home_team, s.away_team,
    ht.team_name as home_team_name, at.team_name as away_team_name,
    hc.name as home_club_name, ac.name as away_club_name,
    hc.club_address as home_club_address, l.league_name
FROM schedule s
JOIN teams ht ON s.home_team_id = ht.id
JOIN teams at ON s.away_team_id = at.id
JOIN clubs hc ON ht.club_id = hc.id
JOIN clubs ac ON at.club_id = ac.id
JOIN leagues l ON s.league_id = l.id
WHERE (s.home_team_id IN ({team_ids}) OR s.away_team_id IN ({team_ids}))
AND s.match_date BETWEEN %s AND %s
ORDER BY s.match_date, s.match_time
```

### Calendar Generation

#### Practices
- **Title**: "Practice"
- **Time**: From `start_time` to `end_time` (or +90 min default)
- **Description**: Team name, club name, league name, location (if available)
- **Recurrence**: Weekly on specified day of week throughout season

#### Matches
- **Title**: `[Club Name] [Team Name] (HOME/AWAY) vs [Opponent]`
- **Time**: From `match_time` (or 6 PM default) for 2 hours
- **Location**: Home club name
- **Description**: 
  ```
  League: {league_name}
  Home: {home_team_name}
  Away: {away_team_name}
  Match Location: {home_club_name}
  Direction: {google_maps_link} (if address available)
  ```

### Season Definition
- **Start**: September 1st of current year
- **End**: June 30th of next year
- **Timezone**: Player's `tz_name` or defaults to `America/Chicago`

## User Experience Flow

1. **Discovery**: User sees banner on mobile availability page
2. **Information**: Clicks banner to visit explanation page
3. **Download**: Clicks "Download to My Calendar" button
4. **File**: Receives `.ics` file with complete season schedule
5. **Import**: Opens file in preferred calendar application

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `app/routes/download_routes.py` - Calendar download blueprint and routes
- `templates/mobile/calendar_download.html` - Download explanation page

### Modified Files
- `server.py` - Added download blueprint import and registration
- `templates/mobile/availability.html` - Added calendar download banner
- `requirements.txt` - Added icalendar and pytz dependencies

## Dependencies Added

- `icalendar==5.0.11` - For generating .ics calendar files
- `pytz==2024.1` - For timezone handling

## Testing

âœ… **Calendar Generation**: Basic calendar creation, event creation, serialization  
âœ… **Timezone Handling**: America/Chicago and other timezone support  
âœ… **Date Calculations**: Season start/end date calculations  
âœ… **Weekday Logic**: Practice recurrence calculations  
âœ… **Route Registration**: Blueprint properly registered in Flask app  
âœ… **Authentication**: Routes properly protected with login_required  

## Security Features

- **Authentication Required**: All routes protected with `@login_required`
- **User Isolation**: Users can only download their own team schedules
- **Input Validation**: Proper parameter validation and error handling
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Uses parameterized queries

## Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Queries**: Single queries with JOINs instead of N+1 queries
- **Batch Processing**: Processes all practices and matches in single database calls
- **Memory Efficient**: Generates calendar in memory and streams response

## Future Enhancements

1. **Calendar Updates**: Allow users to subscribe to calendar updates
2. **Custom Date Ranges**: Let users select custom date ranges
3. **Event Filtering**: Allow users to select which types of events to include
4. **Calendar Sync**: Direct integration with Google/Apple calendars
5. **Notifications**: Calendar change notifications

## Usage Instructions

1. Navigate to mobile availability page
2. Click "Download" button in blue banner
3. Read explanation and click "Download to My Calendar"
4. Open downloaded .ics file in calendar application
5. Confirm import of all events

### For Developers
1. Ensure `icalendar` and `pytz` packages are installed
2. Calendar generation functions are in `download_routes.py`
3. Routes are automatically registered when server starts
4. Test with authenticated user session

## Status

ðŸŽ¯ **READY FOR PRODUCTION** - All functionality implemented and tested successfully.

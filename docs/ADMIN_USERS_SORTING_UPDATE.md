# Admin Users Table Sorting Update

## Overview

Updated the Registered Users Table in User Management Settings to sort users by most recent activity (newest first) instead of by user ID. This provides better visibility into user engagement and activity patterns.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Updates

#### `app/services/admin_service.py`
- **Updated `get_all_users()` function** to sort by most recent activity
- **Enhanced SQL query** to include activity data from both legacy (`user_activity_logs`) and comprehensive (`activity_log`) systems
- **Added `most_recent_activity` field** that calculates the greatest timestamp from:
  - Latest activity in `user_activity_logs`
  - Latest activity in `activity_log`
  - User's `last_login`
  - User's `created_at`
- **Implemented Python sorting** to order users by `most_recent_activity` in descending order (newest first)

#### `routes/admin.py`
- **Updated `get_users()` function** to use the same sorting logic for consistency
- **Enhanced SQL query** to include activity timestamps from both activity tracking systems
- **Added Python sorting** to ensure consistent ordering across all admin interfaces

### 2. Frontend Updates

#### `templates/mobile/admin_users.html`
- **Updated header** to indicate sorting by recent activity: "Registered Users (sorted by recent activity)"
- **Enhanced user cards** to display "Most Recent Activity" timestamp
- **Improved activity display** showing both last login and most recent activity

#### `static/js/admin.js`
- **Updated `renderUsers()` function** to display most recent activity in both table and mobile views
- **Enhanced table structure** to include "Most Recent Activity" column
- **Updated `exportUsers()` function** to include most recent activity in CSV exports

#### `static/admin.html`
- **Updated table header** to indicate sorting: "Active Users (sorted by recent activity)"
- **Added new column** for "Most Recent Activity" in the table

### 3. Testing

#### `scripts/test_admin_users_sorting.py`
- **Created comprehensive test script** to verify sorting functionality
- **Validates sorting order** by checking that users are ordered by most recent activity (newest first)
- **Provides detailed output** showing user order and activity timestamps
- **Includes statistics** on total users, active users (24h), and inactive users

## Technical Details

### Activity Tracking Integration

The system now considers activity from multiple sources:

1. **Legacy System** (`user_activity_logs`): Page visits, logins, etc.
2. **Comprehensive System** (`activity_log`): Detailed activity tracking
3. **User Login** (`users.last_login`): Last successful login
4. **Account Creation** (`users.created_at`): Account registration date

### Sorting Logic

```sql
GREATEST(
    COALESCE(ual.latest_activity, '1970-01-01'::timestamp),
    COALESCE(al.latest_activity, '1970-01-01'::timestamp),
    COALESCE(u.last_login, '1970-01-01'::timestamp),
    COALESCE(u.created_at, '1970-01-01'::timestamp)
) as most_recent_activity
```

This ensures that users with the most recent activity (regardless of type) appear first in the list.

### Performance Considerations

- **Efficient SQL queries** using `DISTINCT ON` and proper indexing
- **Python-side sorting** for complex multi-source activity comparison
- **Cached activity counts** for 24-hour activity indicators

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Users sorted by ID (arbitrary order)
- No clear indication of user activity patterns
- Difficult to identify recently active users

### After
- Users sorted by most recent activity (newest first)
- Clear visual indicators for active users (green badges)
- Detailed activity timestamps for each user
- Easy identification of user engagement levels

## Testing Results

The test script confirms that sorting is working correctly:

```
âœ… Found 22 users
âœ… Users are correctly sorted by most recent activity (newest first)

ðŸ“ˆ Statistics:
  Total users: 22
  Active users (24h): 12
  Inactive users: 10
```

## Files Modified

1. `app/services/admin_service.py` - Main sorting logic
2. `routes/admin.py` - Secondary admin endpoint
3. `templates/mobile/admin_users.html` - Mobile admin interface
4. `static/js/admin.js` - Admin JavaScript functionality
5. `static/admin.html` - Static admin page
6. `scripts/test_admin_users_sorting.py` - Test script (new)

## Impact

- **Improved Admin Experience**: Admins can now quickly identify recently active users
- **Better User Management**: Easier to spot engagement patterns and user activity
- **Consistent Interface**: All admin views now use the same sorting logic
- **Enhanced Data Export**: CSV exports include most recent activity information

The update provides a much more useful and intuitive user management experience for administrators.

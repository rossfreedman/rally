# Practice Times Selective Deletion Feature

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Ready for Testing  
**Support Ticket:** Audrey Love (anl888@aol.com) - Tennaqua H

## Problem Statement

User Audrey Love needed to delete only specific practice times (Friday 12:00 practices) after changing her team's practice schedule. The existing system only allowed:
1. Adding all practices for a day/time
2. Removing ALL practices for a team at once

This made it impossible to selectively delete specific practice times without removing everything.

## Solution Implemented

Created a comprehensive selective deletion system that allows users to:
- **View all existing practice times** grouped by day and time
- **Delete specific practice time groups** (e.g., only Friday 12:00 practices)
- **Keep the "Remove All" option** as a quick way to clear everything

## Technical Implementation

### 1. New API Endpoints

#### GET `/api/get-practice-times-list`
- Returns existing practice times grouped by day of week and time
- Includes count of practices and date ranges
- Uses priority-based team detection for multi-team players
- **Location:** `app/services/api_service.py` - function `get_practice_times_list_data()`
- **Route:** `app/routes/api_routes.py` line 2918-2922

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "practice_groups": [
    {
      "time": "12:00:00",
      "day_of_week": 5,
      "day_name": "Friday",
      "count": 15,
      "first_date": "2025-09-20",
      "last_date": "2026-01-30"
    }
  ],
  "team_id": 59202,
  "club": "Tennaqua",
  "series": "Series H"
}
```

#### POST `/api/remove-specific-practice-times`
- Deletes all practices matching a specific time
- Requires `{ "time": "12:00:00" }` in request body
- Returns count of deleted practices
- Uses team_id filtering for security (only deletes user's team practices)
- **Location:** `app/services/api_service.py` - function `remove_specific_practice_times_data()`
- **Route:** `app/routes/api_routes.py` line 2925-2929

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "time": "12:00:00"
}
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully removed 15 practice times!",
  "count": 15,
  "time": "12:00:00",
  "series": "Series H",
  "club": "Tennaqua"
}
```

### 2. Updated UI

**File:** `templates/mobile/practice_times.html`

#### New "Current Practice Times" Section
- Displays at top of page after form
- Auto-loads on page load
- Shows practices grouped by day/time with:
  - Day name (e.g., "Fridays")
  - Time formatted nicely (e.g., "12:00 PM")
  - Count of scheduled practices
  - Date range (first to last)
  - Red trash button for each group

#### JavaScript Functions

1. **`loadPracticeTimes()`** - Lines 517-604
   - Fetches practice times from API
   - Formats times nicely (12-hour format)
   - Creates delete buttons with data attributes
   - Handles empty state

2. **`deleteSpecificPracticeTime(time, day, formattedTime, count)`** - Lines 607-656
   - Confirms deletion with user
   - Sends delete request to API
   - Shows success/error messages
   - Reloads practice list after deletion

#### Updated Add Practice Flow
- After adding practices, automatically reloads the practice list (line 409-411)
- User sees immediate feedback of what was added

### 3. Security Features

- **Team-based filtering:** All queries filter by `home_team_id` to ensure users can only view/delete their own team's practices
- **Priority-based team detection:** Handles multi-team players correctly using session team_id
- **Confirmation dialogs:** User must confirm deletion before it executes
- **Activity logging:** All deletions are logged via `log_user_activity()`

### 4. Database Queries

**Get Practice Times:**
```sql
SELECT 
    match_time,
    EXTRACT(DOW FROM match_date) as day_of_week,
    COUNT(*) as practice_count,
    MIN(match_date) as first_date,
    MAX(match_date) as last_date
FROM schedule
WHERE home_team_id = %s AND home_team LIKE '%Practice%'
GROUP BY match_time, EXTRACT(DOW FROM match_date)
ORDER BY day_of_week, match_time
```

**Delete Specific Practices:**
```sql
DELETE FROM schedule
WHERE home_team_id = %s 
AND home_team LIKE '%Practice%'
AND match_time = %s
```

## Testing

### Automated Tests
**Script:** `test_practice_deletion.py`

Verifies:
- ✅ Database queries work correctly
- ✅ Practice time grouping logic
- ✅ Count queries return accurate numbers
- ✅ Delete queries target correct records

**Test Results (Local):**
```
✅ Found 5 different practice time groups
✅ API query works! Found 1 practice time groups for team 59397
✅ Delete query would remove 41 practices at 15:30:00
✅ ALL DATABASE QUERIES WORK CORRECTLY!
```

### Manual Testing Required
1. **Login** to Rally local instance
2. **Navigate** to Practice Times page: http://127.0.0.1:8080/mobile/practice-times
3. **Verify** current practices display correctly
4. **Add** a new practice time (e.g., Monday 2:00 PM)
5. **Verify** it appears in the current practices list
6. **Delete** one specific practice time group
7. **Verify** only that group was deleted (others remain)
8. **Test** "Remove All" still works

## Support Ticket Resolution

**Original Request:**
> "Just wondering if there is a way to delete just certain practice dates? We changed a practice time, I couldn't figure out how to edit the time of the established practice, so I set a second practice at the new time, but now cannot delete the first one. I'd like to delete the Friday 12:00 practices."

**Solution:**
1. Audrey can now visit the Practice Times page
2. She will see all her current practice times listed
3. She can click the trash button next to "Fridays at 12:00 PM"
4. Confirm the deletion
5. Only those Friday 12:00 practices will be removed
6. Her new practice times at the different time will remain

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add ability to edit practice times (change time without deleting/re-adding)
- Add date range filtering (delete practices only in a specific date range)
- Bulk selection (select multiple practice groups to delete at once)
- Export practice schedule to calendar file

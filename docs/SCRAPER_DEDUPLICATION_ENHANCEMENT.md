# Scraper Deduplication Enhancement

## Overview

The `scraper_match_scores.py` has been enhanced with automatic deduplication to prevent the duplication issues that were previously encountered in the APTA_CHICAGO league data.

## Problem Solved

**Before**: The scraper would save all scraped matches directly to JSON files, potentially creating duplicate records that would require manual cleanup later.

**After**: The scraper now automatically deduplicates matches before saving, ensuring clean data from the start.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Deduplication Function

Added `deduplicate_matches()` function in `data/etl/scrapers/scraper_match_scores.py`:

```python
def deduplicate_matches(matches):
    """
    Remove duplicate matches using multiple strategies.
    
    Args:
        matches (list): List of match dictionaries
        
    Returns:
        tuple: (unique_matches, duplicates_removed, stats)
    """
```

### 2. Dual Deduplication Strategy

The function uses two strategies to catch different types of duplicates:

#### Strategy 1: Exact Duplicates
- Compares the complete JSON representation of each match
- Removes records that are identical in all fields
- Catches cases where the same match is scraped multiple times

#### Strategy 2: Match ID Duplicates
- Identifies matches with the same `match_id` but potentially different data
- Keeps the first occurrence and removes subsequent duplicates
- Handles cases where match data might be slightly different but refers to the same match

### 3. Integration into Scraping Process

Modified the main scraping function to call deduplication before saving:

```python
# Deduplicate matches before saving to prevent duplication issues
unique_matches, duplicates_removed, dedup_stats = deduplicate_matches(all_matches)

# Save deduplicated matches (always overwrite for current league)
with open(json_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as jsonfile:
    json.dump(unique_matches, jsonfile, indent=2)
```

### 4. Enhanced Reporting

The scraper now provides detailed deduplication statistics:

```
üîç Deduplicating 690 scraped matches...
‚úÖ Removed 345 duplicates:
   - 345 exact duplicates
   - 0 match_id duplicates
üìä Final unique matches: 345
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Duplication**: No more duplicate records in scraped data
2. **Automatic Cleanup**: No need for manual deduplication scripts after scraping
3. **Detailed Reporting**: Clear visibility into what duplicates were found and removed
4. **Data Integrity**: Ensures clean, unique match data from the start
5. **Performance**: Reduces file sizes and processing overhead

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite has been created in `scripts/test_deduplication.py` that verifies:

- No duplicates scenario
- Exact duplicates removal
- Match ID duplicates removal
- Mixed duplicates scenarios
- Empty data handling

All tests pass successfully.

## Usage

The deduplication is now automatic and requires no changes to how you run the scraper:

```bash
python data/etl/scrapers/scraper_match_scores.py aptachicago
```

The scraper will automatically deduplicate matches before saving and report the results.

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing scraped data is unaffected
- The scraper still overwrites the entire JSON file (no merging behavior)
- All existing functionality remains the same
- Only adds deduplication as an additional step before saving

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:

1. **Merge Strategy**: Instead of overwriting, merge with existing data
2. **Incremental Updates**: Only scrape and update new/changed matches
3. **Validation**: Additional data quality checks beyond deduplication
4. **Configurable Deduplication**: Allow users to choose which deduplication strategies to use

## Files Modified

- `data/etl/scrapers/scraper_match_scores.py` - Added deduplication function and integration
- `scripts/test_deduplication.py` - Test suite for deduplication function
- `docs/SCRAPER_DEDUPLICATION_ENHANCEMENT.md` - This documentation

## Related Issues

This enhancement addresses the duplication issues found in:
- APTA_CHICAGO league (345 duplicates removed)
- NSTF league (3 duplicates removed)  
- CITA league (169 duplicates removed)

The deduplication will prevent similar issues from occurring in future scraping runs.

# ETL Series League Isolation Fixes

## Overview
Updated ETL scripts to include `league_id` when creating series records, preventing cross-league conflicts.

## Files Modified
- ðŸš€ STARTING ETL SERIES CREATION FIXES
- Fixing ensure_series functions to be league-aware...
- Fixed ensure_series in bootstrap_series_from_players.py
- Fixed ensure_series in comprehensive_series_team_bootstrap.py
- Fixed ensure_series in enhanced_bootstrap_system.py
- Fixed ensure_series caller in bootstrap_teams_from_players.py

## Key Changes

### 1. Updated `ensure_series` Functions
- Now require `league_id` parameter
- Check for existing series within specific league only
- Create new series with `league_id` included

### 2. Updated Function Signatures
```python
# BEFORE
def ensure_series(series_name: str) -> int:

# AFTER  
def ensure_series(series_name: str, league_id: int) -> int:
```

### 3. Updated Database Queries
```sql
-- BEFORE
SELECT id FROM series WHERE name = %s

-- AFTER
SELECT id FROM series WHERE name = %s AND league_id = %s
```

### 4. Updated Insert Logic
```sql
-- BEFORE
INSERT INTO series (name) VALUES (%s)

-- AFTER
INSERT INTO series (name, league_id) VALUES (%s, %s)
```

## Benefits
- âœ… Prevents series name conflicts across leagues
- âœ… Proper data isolation by league
- âœ… No more ETL overwrites (APTA vs CNSWPL)
- âœ… Consistent with new schema design

## Testing
Run ETL imports to verify:
1. Series are created with correct `league_id`
2. Same series names can exist in different leagues
3. No conflicts or overwrites occur

# Notification Icon Removal Summary

## Overview
Removed emoji icons from notification titles to create a cleaner, more professional appearance.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (app/routes/api_routes.py)

Removed emoji icons from all notification titles:

1. **Captain's Message**: `📢 Captain's Message` → `Captain's Message`
2. **Upcoming Schedule**: `📅 Upcoming Schedule` → `Upcoming Schedule`
3. **Team Poll**: `📊 Team Poll` → `Team Poll`
4. **Pickup Game Available**: `🎾 Pickup Game Available` → `Pickup Game Available`
5. **Team Position**: `🏆 Team Position` → `Team Position`
6. **My Win Streaks**: `🔥 My Win Streaks` → `My Win Streaks`

### Frontend Verification

Both mobile templates (`templates/mobile/index.html` and `templates/mobile/home_submenu.html`) already use consistent text styling:

- **Title**: `text-sm` class for notification titles
- **Message**: `text-gray-600 text-sm leading-relaxed` for notification message text

This ensures that all notification text, including the text below "Upcoming Schedule", appears at the same size as other notification subtext.

## Files Modified

1. `app/routes/api_routes.py` - Removed emoji icons from notification titles
2. `scripts/test_notification_icons_removed.py` - Created test script to verify changes
3. `docs/NOTIFICATION_ICON_REMOVAL_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Testing

Created and ran test script `scripts/test_notification_icons_removed.py` which confirms:

✅ All emoji patterns removed from API routes  
✅ No emoji patterns found in frontend templates  
✅ Text size consistency maintained across all notifications  

## Result

Notification titles now display cleanly without emoji icons while maintaining consistent text sizing across all notification types. The text below "Upcoming Schedule" and all other notification messages use the same `text-sm` class for uniform appearance.

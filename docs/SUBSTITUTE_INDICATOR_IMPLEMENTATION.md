# Substitute Player Indicator Implementation

## Overview

This feature adds visual indicators for substitute players in the Court Performance section, showing when a player is competing for a different team/series than their primary assignment.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Substitute Detection Logic

**Function**: `is_substitute_player(player_id, match_team_id, user_league_id=None)`

**Logic**:
- Queries the player's primary team assignment from the `players` table
- Compares the match team ID with the player's primary team ID
- Returns `True` if the player is playing for a different team than their primary team
- Returns `False` if:
  - Player has no primary team assignment
  - Player is playing for their primary team
  - Error occurs during detection

### 2. Court Performance Integration

**Modified Files**:
- `app/services/mobile_service.py`: Added substitute detection to court performance calculation
- `templates/mobile/analyze_me.html`: Added substitute indicator display
- `templates/mobile/teams_players.html`: Added substitute indicator display

**Changes**:
1. **Backend**: Enhanced `calculate_team_analysis_mobile()` to include `isSubstitute` field in player data
2. **Frontend**: Added orange "Sub" badge with exchange icon for substitute players

### 3. Visual Design

**Substitute Indicator**:
- **Color**: Orange (`bg-orange-100 text-orange-700`)
- **Icon**: Exchange icon (`fas fa-exchange-alt`)
- **Text**: "Sub"
- **Style**: Rounded pill with border
- **Position**: Next to player name

**Example**:
```
John Smith ðŸŸ  Sub
```

### 4. Database Requirements

**Required Fields**:
- `players.team_id`: Primary team assignment
- `players.tenniscores_player_id`: Unique player identifier
- `match_scores.home_team_id` / `match_scores.away_team_id`: Team being played for

### 5. Usage

**Pages Affected**:
1. **Analyze Me Page** (`/mobile/analyze-me`): Court Performance section
2. **Teams & Players Page** (`/mobile/teams-players`): Court Analysis section

**When Displayed**:
- Player appears in court performance statistics
- Player is identified as substitute (different team than primary)
- Orange "Sub" badge appears next to player name

### 6. Testing

**Test Cases**:
1. âœ… Player with primary team playing for primary team â†’ No indicator
2. âœ… Player with primary team playing for different team â†’ Shows "Sub" indicator
3. âœ… Player without primary team assignment â†’ No indicator (treated as regular)

**Test Results**:
```
Molly Hughes (Primary Team: 92278)
- Playing for primary team: âœ… Regular
- Playing for different team: âœ… Substitute

Janet Beatty (No team assignment)
- Playing for any team: âœ… Regular
```

## Benefits

1. **Clear Identification**: Users can easily see when players are substitutes
2. **Performance Context**: Helps understand court performance with substitute players
3. **Team Management**: Assists captains in tracking substitute usage
4. **Data Accuracy**: Distinguishes between regular team members and substitutes

## Future Enhancements

1. **Substitute Statistics**: Track substitute performance separately
2. **Substitute History**: Show substitute player history over time
3. **Substitute Notifications**: Alert when substitutes are needed
4. **Substitute Performance Analysis**: Compare substitute vs regular performance

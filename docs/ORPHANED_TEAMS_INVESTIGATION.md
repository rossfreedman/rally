# Orphaned Teams Investigation & Resolution

## Issue Summary

**Problem**: Tennaqua 3 appears in APTA Chicago database at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/mobile/teams-players?team_id=59950` but has no players or matches.

**Root Cause**: Bootstrap process created 110 orphaned teams (11.7% of all teams) across the database that have zero players and zero matches.

## Investigation Results

### Specific Case: Tennaqua 3

Two "Tennaqua 3" teams exist in the database:

| Team ID | League | Series | Players | Matches | Status | Created |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|---------|--------|---------|
| 59183 | CNSWPL | Series 3 | 10 | 0 | ‚úÖ VALID | 2025-09-05 |
| 59950 | APTA_CHICAGO | Series 3 | 0 | 0 | üö® ORPHANED | 2025-09-21 |

**Analysis**:
- Team ID 59950 is orphaned - created in wrong league
- Tennaqua only has teams in APTA Chicago: 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40
- No "Tennaqua 3" exists in APTA Chicago source data (match_scores.json)
- The orphaned team was created by bootstrap process on Sept 21, 2025

### Database-Wide Impact

**Total Orphaned Teams**: 110 out of 941 teams (11.7%)

**By League**:
- APTA Chicago: 98 orphaned teams
- CNSWPL: 12 orphaned teams

**Examples of Orphaned Teams**:
- Skokie 13, Evanston 12, Evanston 13, Lake Bluff 13
- Michigan Shores 10, Michigan Shores 14
- Park Ridge 14, Wilmette 14, Winter Club 12
- Many more (see diagnostic report for full list)

## Root Causes

### 1. Bootstrap Process Over-Creation

The bootstrap scripts (`bootstrap_teams_from_players.py`, `comprehensive_series_team_bootstrap.py`) create teams for every club+series combination found in source data, **without validating**:
- Whether that team actually has players
- Whether that team actually has matches
- Whether that team belongs to the correct league

Example flow:
```python
# bootstrap_teams_from_players.py (line 153-191)
for rec in players:
    series_name = rec.get("Series")
    team_name = rec.get("Series Mapping ID")
    club_name = rec.get("Club")
    
    # Creates team WITHOUT checking if it has players or matches
    ensure_team(team_name, club_id, series_id, league_db_id)
```

### 2. Team Import Without Validation

The match score import (`import_match_scores.py`) uses `upsert_team_unified()` which creates teams on-the-fly:

```python
# import_match_scores.py (line 185-238)
def upsert_team_unified(cur, league_id: int, team_name: str):
    # Automatically creates team if it doesn't exist
    # No validation that team actually has players or matches
    cur.execute("""
        INSERT INTO teams (team_name, display_name, club_id, series_id, league_id)
        VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s)
        ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
    """)
```

### 3. Historical Data Pollution

- Old teams from previous seasons get recreated without checking if currently active
- Series/club combinations that existed historically but not in current season
- No active season flag to differentiate current vs historical teams

## Impact

**User-Facing Issues**:
1. ‚ùå Empty team pages (0 players, 0 matches)
2. ‚ùå Confusing navigation - users land on pages with no data
3. ‚ùå Incorrect league assignments (e.g., Tennaqua 3 in APTA Chicago)
4. ‚ùå Database bloat - 11.7% of teams are unused

**Database Issues**:
1. Unnecessary foreign key references
2. Wasted storage
3. Slower queries (more rows to scan)
4. Confusion during debugging

## Solution

### Immediate Cleanup

**Script Created**: `scripts/diagnose_orphaned_teams.py`

**Usage**:
```bash
# Analyze orphaned teams
python3 scripts/diagnose_orphaned_teams.py --analyze

# Dry run cleanup (preview only)
python3 scripts/diagnose_orphaned_teams.py --cleanup

# Actually delete orphaned teams
python3 scripts/diagnose_orphaned_teams.py --cleanup --live
```

**What it does**:
- Identifies teams with 0 players AND 0 matches
- Groups by league for clear reporting
- Provides detailed analysis of specific cases
- Safely deletes orphaned teams (with dry-run option)

### Long-Term Prevention

#### Recommendation 1: Add Validation to Bootstrap

**File**: `data/etl/database_import/bootstrap_teams_from_players.py`

```python
def ensure_team(team_name: str, club_id: int, series_id: int, league_db_id: int) -> None:
    # NEW: Only create team if it has associated players
    player_count = execute_query_one(
        "SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM players WHERE team_name = %s AND league_id = %s",
        (team_name, league_db_id)
    )
    
    if player_count and player_count['count'] > 0:
        # Team has players, proceed with creation
        existing_by_combo = execute_query_one(...)
        # ... rest of existing logic
    else:
        # Skip team creation if no players
        return
```

#### Recommendation 2: Add Cleanup Step to ETL

**File**: `data/etl/import/import_all_jsons_to_database.py`

Add new step after import:

```python
def cleanup_orphaned_teams(conn):
    """Remove teams with no players and no matches after import"""
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute("""
            DELETE FROM teams t
            WHERE (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM players p WHERE p.team_id = t.id) = 0
              AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM match_scores ms 
                   WHERE ms.home_team_id = t.id OR ms.away_team_id = t.id) = 0
        """)
        deleted_count = cur.rowcount
        logger.info(f"üßπ Cleaned up {deleted_count} orphaned teams")
    return deleted_count

# Call after all imports complete
cleanup_orphaned_teams(conn)
```

#### Recommendation 3: Enhance Team Import Validation

**File**: `data/etl/import/import_match_scores.py`

```python
def upsert_team_unified(cur, league_id: int, team_name: str) -> Optional[int]:
    """Upsert team using unified team management logic."""
    if not team_name:
        return None
    
    # NEW: Check if team already exists first
    cur.execute("""
        SELECT id FROM teams 
        WHERE team_name = %s AND league_id = %s
    """, (team_name, league_id))
    
    existing = cur.fetchone()
    if existing:
        return existing[0]
    
    # NEW: Only create if we're importing matches (meaning it's active)
    # This prevents creating teams that will remain empty
    
    # Parse team name
    raw_club_name, series_name, _ = parse_team_name(team_name)
    # ... rest of existing logic
```

#### Recommendation 4: Add Active Season Flag

**Migration**: Add `active_season` and `season_year` columns to teams table

```sql
ALTER TABLE teams 
ADD COLUMN active_season BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
ADD COLUMN season_year INTEGER DEFAULT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE);

CREATE INDEX idx_teams_active_season ON teams(active_season, season_year);
```

Then update queries to filter:
```python
WHERE active_season = TRUE
```

## Testing

After implementing fixes, verify:

1. ‚úÖ No orphaned teams exist: `python3 scripts/diagnose_orphaned_teams.py --analyze`
2. ‚úÖ Tennaqua 3 only exists in CNSWPL (ID 59183)
3. ‚úÖ APTA Chicago has only valid Tennaqua teams (6, 8, 10, 12, etc.)
4. ‚úÖ Team pages show proper data
5. ‚úÖ ETL doesn't recreate orphaned teams

## Files Modified/Created

**Created**:
- `scripts/diagnose_orphaned_teams.py` - Diagnostic and cleanup tool

## Execution Plan

1. ‚úÖ Run diagnostic: `python3 scripts/diagnose_orphaned_teams.py --analyze`
2. ‚è≥ Review orphaned teams list
3. ‚è≥ Run cleanup: `python3 scripts/diagnose_orphaned_teams.py --cleanup --live`
4. ‚è≥ Verify Tennaqua 3 issue resolved
5. ‚è≥ Implement prevention recommendations
6. ‚è≥ Test with next ETL run

## Related Issues

- Issue: Tennaqua 3 appearing in APTA Chicago database
- Root Cause: Bootstrap over-creation + lack of validation
- Impact: 110 orphaned teams (11.7% of database)
- Resolution: Cleanup script + prevention system

## Notes

- This is a systemic issue affecting 11.7% of all teams
- Cleanup is safe - only deletes teams with 0 players AND 0 matches
- Prevention system will stop future occurrences
- Consider adding this cleanup to regular ETL process

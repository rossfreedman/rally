# Modal Matches Court Assignment Fix

## Issue Summary
The modal matches functionality was showing incorrect court assignments compared to the court analysis display on the analyze-me page.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem
- **Court Analysis Display**: Showed Mike Lieberman with "2 matches" on Court 1
- **Modal Data**: When clicking the link, showed 0 matches for Court 1 filtering
- **API vs Court Analysis**: Different court assignment algorithms caused data mismatch

### Investigation Process
1. **Initial Symptom**: Modal showed "Failed to load matches" in production but worked locally
2. **API Fix**: Fixed league_id mismatch and added missing match_result field
3. **Data Mismatch**: Modal worked but showed wrong court assignments
4. **Debug Logging**: Added detailed logging to trace court extraction logic
5. **Root Cause**: All `tenniscores_match_id` values were `None` in production

### Technical Details
```
Debug logs revealed:
[DEBUG] Processing match ID: None
[DEBUG] No _Line pattern in None
(repeated for all 12 matches)
```

**Court Analysis Fallback Logic**: When `tenniscores_match_id` is None, groups matches by date and team matchup, then assigns courts based on database ID order within each group.

**API Original Logic**: When `tenniscores_match_id` is None, defaulted all matches to Court 1.

## Solution Implemented

### API Court Assignment Fix
Updated `app/routes/api_routes.py` to use the exact same fallback logic as court analysis:

```python
# If no court from tenniscores_match_id, use SAME fallback logic as court analysis
if court_number is None:
    # Use the same database ID order logic as court analysis
    # Group by date and team matchup, then assign based on position within that group
    
    # Get all matches for this date and team matchup
    match_date = match.get("Date")
    home_team = match.get("Home Team", "")
    away_team = match.get("Away Team", "")
    
    # Find all matches on this date with these teams
    same_matchup_query = """
        SELECT id, tenniscores_match_id
        FROM match_scores
        WHERE TO_CHAR(match_date, 'DD-Mon-YY') = %s
        AND home_team = %s AND away_team = %s
        ORDER BY id ASC
    """
    
    try:
        same_matchup_matches = execute_query(same_matchup_query, [match_date, home_team, away_team])
        
        # Find position of current match in this group
        current_match_id = match.get("id")
        match_position = 0
        for i, matchup_match in enumerate(same_matchup_matches):
            if matchup_match.get("id") == current_match_id:
                match_position = i
                break
        
        # Assign court based on position (1-4, same as court analysis)
        court_number = (match_position % 4) + 1
        
    except Exception as e:
        court_number = 1  # Ultimate fallback
```

## Results
- ✅ **Modal Data Consistency**: API court assignments now match court analysis display
- ✅ **Accurate Filtering**: Partner match filtering works correctly across all courts
- ✅ **Production Verified**: Confirmed working in production environment
- ✅ **Performance**: No significant performance impact from additional query

## Files Modified
- `app/routes/api_routes.py` - Updated court assignment fallback logic in `get_current_season_matches`

## Testing
1. Navigate to https://www.lovetorally.com/mobile/analyze-me
2. Click on any partner's match count link (e.g., "2 matches")
3. Verify modal opens with correct matches for the specified court
4. Confirm court assignments match the court analysis display

## Technical Lessons
1. **Consistent Fallback Logic**: When primary data sources fail, all related systems must use identical fallback algorithms
2. **Debug Logging Strategy**: Detailed logging at decision points is crucial for production debugging
3. **Data Environment Differences**: Local vs production data differences can mask logic issues
4. **Court Assignment Complexity**: Tennis court assignment requires sophisticated grouping logic, not simple defaults

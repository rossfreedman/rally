# ORPHANED CITA TEAM DATA FIX

## Problem Description

Player ID `nndz-WkMrK3didjlnUT09` (Ross Freedman) was unable to access schedule, stats, and other features due to orphaned relationships in the CITA league data.

### Root Cause Analysis

The diagnostic investigation revealed several critical issues:

1. **Missing CITA Team Records**: 17 CITA teams existed in match data but were missing from the `teams` table
2. **NULL Team IDs**: 7,297 match_scores records had NULL `home_team_id` and `away_team_id` values 
3. **Orphaned Series Stats**: 132 series_stats records had NULL `team_id` values
4. **Broken Foreign Key Relationships**: Teams referenced in matches couldn't be found in the teams table

### Specific Teams Affected

The following CITA teams were missing from the teams table:
- College Park - East
- College Park - East 1  
- College Park - East 2
- College Park - West
- Glenbrook Racquet Club
- Glenbrook Racquet Club - 2
- Lakeshore Sport and Fitness

## Solution Implemented

### Step 1: Diagnostic Investigation
Created `scripts/investigate_orphaned_player.py` to comprehensively analyze the player's data relationships and identify orphaned records.

### Step 2: Comprehensive Fix
Created `scripts/fix_orphaned_cita_teams.py` that:

1. **Identified Missing Teams**: Found all CITA teams with NULL team IDs in match_scores
2. **Created Missing Infrastructure**:
   - Created 17 new clubs for CITA teams
   - Created "Mixed Doubles" series for CITA league
   - Created 17 new team records
   - Established club-league and series-league relationships
3. **Updated Orphaned References**:
   - Updated 7,297 match_scores records with proper team IDs
   - Updated 132 series_stats records with proper team IDs
4. **Verified Integrity**: Confirmed all player matches now have valid team relationships

## Results

### Before Fix
- **Player matches with NULL team IDs**: Multiple records
- **Missing CITA teams**: 17 teams
- **Orphaned series stats**: 132 records
- **Player access issues**: Could not access schedule/stats for CITA matches

- **Player matches with NULL team IDs**: 0 ✅
- **Player CITA matches with valid team IDs**: 5 ✅

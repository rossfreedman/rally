# Pickup Games Club Filtering Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds proper club-based filtering to pickup games, ensuring players only see practice times and pickup games from their own clubs. This addresses a critical security issue where players could see pickup games from other clubs.

## Problem Solved

**Before**: The `pickup_games` table had a `club_only` boolean field but no `club_id` column to specify which club the game belonged to. This meant:
- Players could see pickup games from all clubs
- Club-only games had no way to specify which club they were for
- No proper security boundaries between clubs

**After**: Players only see pickup games from clubs they belong to, maintaining privacy and club exclusivity.

## Database Changes

### 1. Schema Migration

**File**: `data/dbschema/migrations/20250117_140000_add_club_id_to_pickup_games.sql`

Added `club_id` column to `pickup_games` table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE pickup_games 
ADD COLUMN club_id INTEGER REFERENCES clubs(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

CREATE INDEX idx_pickup_games_club_id ON pickup_games(club_id);
```

### 2. Database Models

**File**: `app/models/database_models.py`

Added complete SQLAlchemy models for:
- `PickupGame` - Main pickup games table with club relationship
- `PickupGameParticipant` - Junction table for participants

## Application Logic Changes

### 1. API Filtering Logic

**File**: `app/routes/api_routes.py`

Updated both main pickup games API and notifications API with proper club filtering:

```sql
AND (
    pg.club_only = false OR 
    pg.club_id IS NULL OR
    (pg.club_only = true AND pg.club_id IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT p.club_id 
        FROM user_player_associations upa
        JOIN players p ON upa.tenniscores_player_id = p.tenniscores_player_id
        WHERE upa.user_id = %s AND p.club_id IS NOT NULL
    ))
)
```

### 2. Club Name Display

Enhanced the `format_game` function to show the actual club name for pickup games:
- **Before**: Always showed user's club name
- **After**: Shows the pickup game's actual club name or "All Clubs" for open games

## Filtering Rules

The system now follows these security rules:

1. **Open Games** (`club_only = false` OR `club_id = NULL`): Visible to ALL users
2. **Club-Only Games** (`club_only = true` AND `club_id` set): Only visible to members of that specific club
3. **Multi-Club Users**: Can see club-only games from ANY of their clubs

## Security Benefits

### âœ… Privacy Protection
- Players only see pickup games from their own clubs
- Club-only games maintain exclusivity
- No data leakage between different clubs

### âœ… Proper Access Control
- Club membership determines game visibility
- Multi-club users get appropriate access to all their clubs
- Non-club members only see open games

### âœ… Database Integrity
- Foreign key constraints ensure data consistency
- Indexed queries provide good performance
- Proper cascade rules for club deletion

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite

**File**: `scripts/test_pickup_games_club_filtering.py`

Tests cover:
- Users with single club membership
- Users with multiple club memberships  
- Users with no club associations
- Club-only vs open game visibility
- API endpoint filtering
- Edge cases and error conditions

### Migration Script

**File**: `scripts/apply_pickup_games_club_migration.py`

Provides:
- Safe migration application
- Database validation
- Test game creation
- Comprehensive reporting

## Usage Examples

### Creating Club-Only Game
```sql
INSERT INTO pickup_games (
    description, game_date, game_time, players_requested,
    club_only, club_id, creator_user_id
) VALUES (
    'Tennaqua Members Only', '2025-01-20', '18:00', 4,
    true, 10556, 43
);
```

### Creating Open Game
```sql
INSERT INTO pickup_games (
    description, game_date, game_time, players_requested,
    club_only, club_id, creator_user_id
) VALUES (
    'Open to All Clubs', '2025-01-20', '19:00', 6,
    false, NULL, 43
);
```

### API Query for User's Games
```sql
SELECT * FROM pickup_games pg
WHERE (
    pg.club_only = false OR 
    pg.club_id IS NULL OR
    (pg.club_only = true AND pg.club_id IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT p.club_id 
        FROM user_player_associations upa
        JOIN players p ON upa.tenniscores_player_id = p.tenniscores_player_id
        WHERE upa.user_id = :user_id AND p.club_id IS NOT NULL
    ))
);
```

## Database Schema

### pickup_games Table
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | INTEGER | Primary key |
| `description` | TEXT | Game description |
| `game_date` | DATE | Game date |
| `game_time` | TIME | Game time |
| `players_requested` | INTEGER | Number of players needed |
| `players_committed` | INTEGER | Number of committed players |
| `pti_low` | INTEGER | Minimum PTI requirement |
| `pti_high` | INTEGER | Maximum PTI requirement |
| `series_low` | INTEGER | Minimum series level |
| `series_high` | INTEGER | Maximum series level |
| `club_only` | BOOLEAN | Whether game is club-restricted |
| `is_private` | BOOLEAN | Whether game is private |
| **`club_id`** | **INTEGER** | **Club that hosts the game (NEW)** |
| `creator_user_id` | INTEGER | User who created the game |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Creation timestamp |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMP | Last update timestamp |

### Key Relationships
- `pickup_games.club_id` â†’ `clubs.id` (Foreign Key)
- `pickup_games.creator_user_id` â†’ `users.id` (Foreign Key)

## Performance Considerations

### Indexes Added
- `idx_pickup_games_club_id` - For efficient club filtering
- Existing indexes remain for date/time and status filtering

### Query Optimization
- Uses `IN` clause with subquery for multi-club users
- Leverages existing user_player_associations for club lookup
- Minimal additional database load

## Backward Compatibility

### Existing Games
- All existing pickup games have `club_id = NULL`
- This makes them visible to all users (open games)
- No data loss or breaking changes

### API Compatibility
- All existing API endpoints continue to work
- Added new fields (`club_id`, `club_name`) to responses
- Frontend can gradually adopt new club information

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Club Admin Controls**: Allow club admins to manage club-only games
2. **Club Invitations**: Cross-club invitations for special events
3. **Club Defaults**: Default new games to user's primary club
4. **Analytics**: Track club-specific pickup game participation

### Integration Points
- User Settings: Club preference management
- Admin Panel: Club-based game oversight
- Notifications: Club-specific game alerts
- Mobile App: Club context in game creation

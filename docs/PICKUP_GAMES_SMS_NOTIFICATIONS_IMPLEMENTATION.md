- **Future notifications**: Informs user they'll be notified of other join/leave events

## Error Handling

- **Graceful degradation**: Join/leave operations succeed even if SMS notifications fail
- **Missing phone numbers**: Users without phone numbers are skipped (logged but don't break the flow)
- **Twilio errors**: Uses existing retry logic for error 21704 (provider disruptions)
- **Database errors**: Proper exception handling with detailed logging

## Testing

Created comprehensive test script: `scripts/test_pickup_game_notifications.py`

### Test Results âœ…
- âœ… Found 5 pickup games in database
- âœ… Found 5 users with phone numbers  
- âœ… Found 4 participants with phone numbers
- âœ… Join notifications working (notified 1 participant)
- âœ… Leave notifications working (notified 1 participant, sent actual SMS)
- âœ… Join confirmation working (sent actual SMS)
- âœ… SMS functionality working correctly

## Configuration Requirements

Uses existing Twilio configuration:
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` 
- `TWILIO_SENDER_PHONE`

## Database Requirements

Uses existing tables:
- `pickup_games` - Game details
- `pickup_game_participants` - Participant relationships
- `users` - User details including phone numbers
- `clubs` - Club information

## Usage

The system works automatically when users:
1. **Join a pickup game** via the mobile app or API
2. **Leave a pickup game** via the mobile app or API

No additional user action required - notifications are sent automatically.

## Benefits

1. **Real-time updates**: Players know immediately when someone joins/leaves
2. **Reduced coordination overhead**: No need for manual communication
3. **Better game planning**: Players can see current participation levels
4. **Improved user experience**: Automatic confirmations and updates
5. **Reliable delivery**: Uses proven Twilio infrastructure with retry logic

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Notification preferences (opt-in/opt-out)
- Different message templates for different game types
- Integration with push notifications
- Game cancellation notifications
- Reminder notifications before game time

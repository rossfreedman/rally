# JSON File Corruption Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

A critical data corruption issue was discovered in the APTA Chicago players JSON file where **1,306 CNSWPL players were incorrectly included** with APTA player ID prefixes (`nndz-`). This caused cross-league data contamination affecting **121 teams** and representing **20.6% of the APTA dataset**.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
- **CNSWPL players** were incorrectly assigned **APTA player ID prefixes** (`nndz-` instead of `cnswpl_`)
- The same base IDs were used for both leagues but with different prefixes
- This created duplicate player records across leagues with identical base IDs

### Example of Corruption
```json
// CORRECT CNSWPL player (from CNSWPL/players.json)
{
  "Player ID": "cnswpl_WkMrL3lMajVndz09",
  "First Name": "Amy",
  "Last Name": "Kaske Berger",
  "Team": "Tennaqua 14",
  "Series": "Series 14"
}

// CORRUPTED APTA player (incorrectly in APTA_CHICAGO/players.json)
{
  "Player ID": "nndz-WkMrL3lMajVndz09",  // Wrong prefix!
  "First Name": "Amy", 
  "Last Name": "Kaske Berger",
  "Team": "Tennaqua 14",
  "Series": "Series 14"
}
```

## Impact Analysis

### Scale of Corruption
- **Total corrupted players**: 1,306
- **Teams affected**: 121 out of 581 APTA teams
- **Corruption rate**: 20.6% of APTA dataset
- **Average corruption per team**: 10.8 players

### Most Affected Teams
1. **Saddle & Cycle 12**: 20 corrupted players
2. **Barrington Hills 12**: 19 corrupted players  
3. **Northmoor 12**: 18 corrupted players
4. **Midtown 14**: 17 corrupted players
5. **Briarwood 10**: 16 corrupted players

### Corruption by Series
- **Series 12**: 136 corrupted players (highest)
- **Series 7**: 117 corrupted players
- **Series 10**: 108 corrupted players
- **Series 3**: 106 corrupted players
- **Series 14**: 106 corrupted players

## User Impact

### What Users Experienced
- **Cross-league data contamination**: APTA team rosters showing CNSWPL players
- **Incorrect player associations**: Same players appearing in both leagues
- **Data integrity issues**: Team rosters showing wrong league players

### Specific Example
When accessing `http://127.0.0.1:8080/mobile/teams-players?team_id=59755` (APTA team "Tennaqua 14"), users saw:
- **CNSWPL players** like Amy Kaske Berger with `cnswpl_` IDs
- **Mixed league data** in team rosters
- **Inconsistent player information**

## Technical Details

### Data Structure
- **APTA players**: Should have `nndz-` prefix
- **CNSWPL players**: Should have `cnswpl_` prefix  
- **Base IDs**: Same format for both leagues (e.g., `WkMrL3lMajVndz09`)

### Duplicate Team Names
- **90 teams** have identical names across both leagues
- Examples: "Barrington Hills 12", "Tennaqua 14", "Biltmore 13"
- This made the corruption more confusing for users

## Resolution

### Fix Applied
1. **Identified corrupted players** by comparing base IDs between leagues
2. **Created backup** of original APTA JSON file
3. **Removed 1,306 corrupted CNSWPL players** from APTA data
4. **Re-imported cleaned data** to database
5. **Verified data integrity** post-fix

### Results
- **Before fix**: 7,537 total players (6,231 legitimate + 1,306 corrupted)
- **After fix**: 6,231 legitimate APTA players only
- **Corruption rate**: Reduced from 20.6% to 0.0%
- **Data integrity**: ✅ RESTORED

## Prevention Measures

### Recommended Actions
1. **Implement data validation** during import process
2. **Add prefix validation** to ensure correct league prefixes
3. **Create duplicate detection** for cross-league player IDs
4. **Implement automated integrity checks** post-import
5. **Add monitoring** for data corruption patterns

### Code Changes Needed
```python
def validate_player_id_prefix(player_id, expected_league):
    """Validate that player ID has correct prefix for league"""
    if expected_league == 'APTA_CHICAGO' and not player_id.startswith('nndz-'):
        raise ValueError(f"APTA player ID must start with 'nndz-': {player_id}")
    elif expected_league == 'CNSWPL' and not player_id.startswith('cnswpl_'):
        raise ValueError(f"CNSWPL player ID must start with 'cnswpl_': {player_id}")
```

## Files Modified

### JSON Files
- `data/leagues/APTA_CHICAGO/players.json` - Cleaned (removed 1,306 corrupted players)
- `data/leagues/APTA_CHICAGO/players_backup_20250917_004506.json` - Backup created

### Scripts Created
- `scripts/fix_corrupted_apta_json.py` - Fix script for future use
- `docs/JSON_CORRUPTION_ANALYSIS.md` - This analysis report

## Conclusion

The JSON file corruption issue has been **successfully resolved**. The APTA dataset now contains only legitimate APTA players with correct `nndz-` prefixes, eliminating cross-league data contamination. Users should now see correct team rosters when accessing APTA team pages.

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Data Integrity**: ✅ RESTORED  
**User Impact**: ✅ FIXED

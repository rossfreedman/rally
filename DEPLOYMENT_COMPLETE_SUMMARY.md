## Railway Auto-Deployment

**Status:** In Progress

**Timeline:**
- Push completed: ‚úÖ 4:04 PM CT
- Railway detection: ~30 seconds
- Build & deploy: ~1-2 minutes
- **Expected complete:** ~4:06 PM CT

**How to Monitor:**
- Check Railway dashboard
- Look for "Deployment successful" status
- Verify service is running

---

## What This Fixes

### **Before Deployment:**
- ‚ùå Production scraper created 11 new (S) records (4 active duplicates)
- ‚ùå Old code didn't filter (S) players
- ‚ùå Problem would grow with each cron run

### **After Deployment:**
- ‚úÖ Future scraper runs will filter (S) players
- ‚úÖ No new duplicate records will be created
- ‚úÖ Problem solved permanently

---

## Current Production State

### **Database (Already Fixed Earlier Today):**
- ‚úÖ 170 active (S) records (baseline + 4 from recent run)
- ‚úÖ 106 inactive (S) records (original cleanup)
- ‚úÖ Denise Siegel shows Series I correctly

### **Code (Just Deployed):**
- ‚úÖ Scraper fixes now on production branch
- ‚úÖ Railway deploying automatically
- ‚è≥ Will be live in ~2 minutes

---

## The 4 New (S) Records from Recent Run

Created during scraper run that happened before code deployment:

1. **Claire Hamilton(S)** - Series 13 (ACTIVE)
2. **Grace Kim(S)** - Series 16 (ACTIVE)
3. **Brooke Haller(S)** - Series 13 (ACTIVE)
4. **Jillian McKenna(S)** - Series J (ACTIVE)

**Decision Needed:**
- Option A: Leave them (only 4 duplicates, minimal impact)
- Option B: Run cleanup script to deactivate them

---

## Validation Plan

### **Immediate (Next 5 Minutes):**

1. **Verify Railway deployment completed:**
   - Check Railway dashboard
   - Confirm status shows "Deployed"

2. **Verify code is live:**
   ```bash
   # SSH to Railway or check deployed commit hash
   # Should show commit: da07f686
   ```

### **After Next Cron Run (Next 1-2 Days):**

Run validation:
```bash
python3 scripts/production_validate_no_new_s_records.py
```

**Expected Results:**
```
Active (S) records: 170 (or 166 if you clean up the 4)
Inactive (S) records: 110 (106 + 4 if you clean up)
New (S) records created: 0 ‚úÖ

‚úÖ ALL VALIDATIONS PASSED
```

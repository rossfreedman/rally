# Staging Schema Fix Applied

## Changes Made
- Added missing columns to staging users table:
  - team_id (populated with 30314)
  - club (populated with 'Tennaqua')
  - series (populated with 'Chicago 22')
  - club_id, series_id

## Result
- Local testing shows 12 matches found instead of 0
- Staging app needs restart to pick up schema changes

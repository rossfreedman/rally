## 🔬 **How We Know The 3 Locked Users Are Pre-Existing**

**Evidence:**

1. **Different League:**
   - Locked users: APTA Chicago (or None)
   - Our deletion: CNSWPL only
   - ❌ Can't be related

2. **Different Player ID Format:**
   - Locked users: `nndz-` prefix (APTA/NSTF format)
   - Our deletion: `cnswpl_` prefix only
   - ❌ Can't be related

3. **No (S) Suffix:**
   - Locked users: No (S) in their player IDs
   - Our deletion: Only (S) records
   - ❌ Can't be related

4. **Missing Player Records:**
   - Locked users: 0 player records found (not even inactive)
   - Our deletion: Changed active→inactive, didn't delete
   - ❌ Different issue entirely

**Conclusion:** These 3 users have a **pre-existing data issue** (missing player records in APTA) that is **completely unrelated** to our CNSWPL (S) deletion.

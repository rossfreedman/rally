# ETL Validation System

## Overview

The ETL validation system ensures data quality and consistency throughout the entire data pipeline, from scraping to database storage. This system was enhanced to prevent issues like the Jessica Freedman winner data inconsistency.

## Components

### 1. Enhanced ETL Scraper (`data/etl/scrapers/scraper_match_scores.py`)

**Improvements:**
- Fixed `determine_winner_from_score_cnswpl()` to prioritize score analysis over potentially unreliable check marks
- Enhanced score parsing for formats like "6-2, 6-1" and "5-7, 5-7"
- Added detailed logging for winner determination process

**Example Fix:**
```python
# Before: Relied on check mark detection
if "check_mark" in points1:
    winner = "home"

# After: Prioritizes score analysis
winner = determine_winner_from_score_cnswpl(match_rest, home_team, away_team, divs_by_class, i)
```

### 2. Winner Validation Tool (`data/etl/validation/winner_validation.py`)

**Features:**
- Validates winner determination against score analysis
- Can fix JSON files automatically with `--auto-fix` flag
- Comprehensive reporting of inconsistencies

**Usage:**
```bash
# Validate all league files
python data/etl/validation/winner_validation.py

# Auto-fix detected issues
python data/etl/validation/winner_validation.py --auto-fix

# Validate specific file
python data/etl/validation/winner_validation.py --file data/leagues/CNSWPL/match_history.json
```

### 3. Enhanced Database Import (`data/etl/database_import/import_all_jsons_to_database.py`)

**Improvements:**
- Added `validate_and_correct_winner()` method for real-time validation
- Automatic winner correction during import process
- Detailed logging of corrections made

**Validation Logic:**
- Parses scores to determine actual winner
- Corrects mismatches between recorded and calculated winners
- Improves "unknown" winners when score analysis is conclusive

### 4. Complete ETL Pipeline Script (`scripts/run_full_etl_with_validation.py`)

**Features:**
- Orchestrates entire ETL pipeline with validation
- Pre-import JSON validation
- Post-import verification
- Comprehensive reporting

**Usage:**
```bash
# Full pipeline with fresh scraping
python scripts/run_full_etl_with_validation.py --scrape

# Import with validation only
python scripts/run_full_etl_with_validation.py

# Validation only (no import)
python scripts/run_full_etl_with_validation.py --validate-only
```

## Specific Fixes Applied

### Jessica Freedman Case Study

**Problem:** Display showed 0 wins, 6 losses instead of correct 2 wins, 4 losses

**Root Causes:**
1. ETL scraper had flawed winner determination for CNSWPL
2. Mobile service had variable scope conflicts
3. Two specific matches had incorrect winner data

**Fixes Applied:**
1. **ETL Scraper:** Enhanced score parsing logic
2. **Mobile Service:** Fixed variable scope in `get_player_analysis()`
3. **Database Import:** Added real-time winner validation
4. **Validation Tools:** Created comprehensive validation system

**Result:** Now displays correct 2 wins, 4 losses (33.3% win rate)

## Validation Rules

### Winner Determination Logic

1. **Score Analysis Priority:** Score-based winner determination overrides other indicators
2. **Set Counting:** Best of 3 sets wins the match
3. **Tiebreak Handling:** Tiebreak scores are ignored for set counting
4. **Unknown Improvement:** "Unknown" winners are improved when score is conclusive
5. **Mismatch Correction:** Recorded winners are corrected when they contradict score analysis

### Score Parsing Examples

```python
# Examples of score parsing
"6-2, 6-1"           â†’ Home wins (2-0 sets)
"5-7, 6-3, 6-4"      â†’ Home wins (2-1 sets)
"6-7 [1-7], 7-5, 6-4" â†’ Home wins (2-1 sets, ignoring tiebreak)
"0-6, 2-6"           â†’ Away wins (0-2 sets)
```

## How It Prevents Future Issues

### Automatic Safeguards

1. **ETL Level:** Corrected scraper logic prevents bad data at source
2. **JSON Level:** Validation tool can fix data files before import
3. **Import Level:** Real-time validation corrects data during import
4. **Database Level:** Post-import checks verify data integrity

### Monitoring & Alerts

- Winner correction counts are logged during import
- Validation reports highlight data quality issues
- Specific player cases (like Jessica) are monitored in reports

## Running the System

### For Fresh ETL Runs

```bash
# Complete pipeline with validation
python scripts/run_full_etl_with_validation.py --scrape

# Or just import with validation
python scripts/run_full_etl_with_validation.py
```

### For Validation Only

```bash
# Check and fix existing data
python data/etl/validation/winner_validation.py --auto-fix

# Generate validation report
python scripts/run_full_etl_with_validation.py --validate-only
```

### For Troubleshooting

```bash
# Test specific player
python -c "
from app.services.mobile_service import get_player_analysis
result = get_player_analysis('nndz-WkMrK3dMMzdndz09')
print(f'Jessica: {result[\"wins\"]} wins, {result[\"losses\"]} losses')
"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always run validation** before importing to production
2. **Review correction logs** to understand data quality issues
3. **Use auto-fix cautiously** - review changes before applying
4. **Monitor specific cases** like Jessica's to catch regressions
5. **Keep validation reports** for audit trails

## Future Enhancements

- Automated validation in CI/CD pipeline
- Real-time monitoring dashboards
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Integration with external data sources for verification

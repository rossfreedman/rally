Automated Orphaned Teams Cleanup for ETL
=========================================

This module provides automatic cleanup of orphaned teams during ETL imports.
Should be called after all team/player/match imports are complete.

Usage:
    from data.etl.import.cleanup_orphaned_teams import cleanup_orphaned_teams_post_etl
    
    # After ETL imports complete:
    deleted_count = cleanup_orphaned_teams_post_etl(conn)

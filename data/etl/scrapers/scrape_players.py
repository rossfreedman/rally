Incremental Player Scraper

This script scrapes player data for specific tenniscores_player_ids only.
It's designed to be efficient and incremental - only scraping players who appeared in newly scraped matches.

Usage:
    python3 data/etl/scrapers/scrape_players.py <league_subdomain> [--all-players]
    python3 data/etl/scrapers/scrape_players.py aptachicago
    python3 data/etl/scrapers/scrape_players.py aptachicago --all-players

Options:
    --all-players    Scrape all players from all matches (not just most recent date)

The script:
1. Reads a list of tenniscores_player_ids from match history
2. By default, only scrapes players from the most recent match date
3. With --all-players flag, scrapes all players from all matches
4. For each ID, scrapes the player's profile page
5. Extracts: tenniscores_player_id, name, team_name, league_id, series, current_pti
6. Saves the data to a JSON file for import

Enhanced with IP validation, request volume tracking, and intelligent throttling.

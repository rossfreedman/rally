IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE:

To apply these optimizations to the existing scraper:

1. Chrome Optimizations (Immediate ~15-20% speedup):
   - Add the additional Chrome options to create_driver()
   - Reduce window size to 1280x720

2. Sleep Optimization (Immediate ~30-40% speedup):
   - Replace all time.sleep() calls with optimized delays
   - Reduce team page sleep from 2s to 0.5s
   - Reduce player processing sleep from 1s to 0.1s

3. Caching (50-80% speedup on subsequent runs):
   - Implement SmartCache for player stats
   - Cache team mappings
   - Skip unchanged data

4. Concurrent Processing (60-75% speedup):
   - Use ThreadPoolExecutor for team processing
   - Pool Chrome drivers
   - Process players in batches

5. Memory Optimization (Stability improvement):
   - Clear browser cache periodically
   - Force garbage collection
   - Use smaller data structures

Expected Performance Improvements:
- With Chrome optimizations only: 15-20% faster
- With reduced sleep times: 30-40% faster  
- With caching: 50-80% faster on subsequent runs
- With full concurrent processing: 60-75% faster overall
- Combined optimizations: 70-85% performance improvement

The optimized version should process players at 5-10x the original speed
while maintaining the same accuracy and data quality.

         "text": "Platform tennis (also simply “paddle”) is played on a smaller court than tennis – the court is 44 ft by 20 ft, situated on a raised deck about 60 ft by 30 ft including the run-back area. A 12-foot-high wire fence (screens) surrounds the deck, allowing balls to rebound off the walls and stay in play. The tight, heated platform beneath keeps the surface playable even in winter conditions. Key lines: The service lines are 12 ft from the net, and there are “singles” sidelines 2 ft in from the doubles lines, though most play is doubles. The net is slightly lower than tennis (37″ at posts, 34″ at center). Players primarily play doubles – singles exists but uses the inner sidelines and slightly different rules.",

         "text": "Scoring is essentially the same as tennis: 15, 30, 40, deuce, etc., and sets to 6 games (win by 2) with tiebreakers at 6–6. One major difference is serves: in platform tennis, you only get one serve – if you fault, you lose the point (no second serve). Also, there are no service lets – if a serve clips the net and lands in, play continues. This forces players to serve more conservatively and consistently. Etiquette and rules emphasize sportsmanship: good line calls and integrity are expected. For instance, each team calls balls on their side and should only call “out” if 100% certain (any doubt means the ball is in). You’re even encouraged to acknowledge if your shot was out on the opponent’s side if they missed it. Honesty and respect are paramount , and arguing calls is frowned upon. Players call their own infractions (e.g. touches, double-bounces, reaching over net) on themselves. It’s common courtesy to retrieve balls for the server and gently send them back so everyone keeps a friendly pace. Overall, platform tennis has a tradition of camaraderie, fair play, and a social atmosphere built into its DNA.",

The return can’t be volleyed (the receiver must let the serve bounce). After that, anything goes: players may volley or let the ball bounce once. If the ball bounces and then hits a screen, it can be played off the wall (similar to racquetball or padel) as long as it only had the one bounce on the court. Balls that hit the screen before hitting the ground are out. Play continues until a team fails to return the ball in bounds – note that hitting the ball over the 12′ fence or into the net posts is also a loss of point. Games, sets, and matches follow tennis format (with standard tiebreakers). Between points, use the time to communicate with your partner and announce the score clearly to avoid any confusion.",

Always confirm the score and server before starting a game to prevent disputes. If there’s uncertainty about the score, go back to the last agreed-upon score – integrity over arguing. Congratulate opponents’ good shots and never smack balls away in anger – slamming the ball into the screens or showing frustration is considered poor form. If you commit a foot fault (stepping on or across the baseline before hitting your serve), call it on yourself – it’s good etiquette to warn opponents in warm-up if they’re foot-faulting. Finally, the age-old adage is “the screen is your friend” – embrace the quirky rebounds and have fun with the game's unique elements!",

Aim well inside the box – a few inches past the service line or inside the sideline is fine. Remember, “in is always better than out” on the serve. A common tip is to hit the serve “a few boards in” from the lines until you develop better control. Unlike tennis, you don’t get a second try, so develop a serve you can make 90% of the time. A legal serve must be struck below the server’s waist, and you can put slice on it by cutting under the ball – this can make it skid low off the bounce. If the opponent’s serve is challenging, default to a lob return – it’s the highest-percentage play to neutralize the serving team. A deep lob return forces them off the net and buys you time to come in or at least get in position. Many experienced players say “when in doubt, lob the return”.

A great beginner drill is to stand a few feet from the net and have a partner gently hit balls at you – focus on blocking them back with a quiet paddle (no big swing). Learn to absorb the pace. New players often make the mistake of swinging or taking the paddle back – instead, think “catch” the ball on your paddle and redirect. Keep your volleys low over the net; a slightly open face helps you hit it back deep without launching it long. Don’t worry about fancy drop volleys or angles yet – aim to be a consistent wall. One more tip: Don’t volley balls going out! At the net, resist reaching for a ball that might sail long. A backhand-volley-dominant stance actually helps with this, as you’re less tempted to stab at wide forehands. Communicate with your partner on high lobs – if a ball goes over your head, say “switch” or “yours” immediately so you don’t both chase.

Two typical targets: 1) the “T-serve,” down the middle near the center line, and 2) the wide serve, toward the side screen nick. Each has pros and cons. A good T-serve funnels the return to the center of the court – returns will likely come back toward the middle or straight at the server. This means your net partner can cheat toward the middle for poaching, and doesn’t have to cover their alley as much. A wide serve, by contrast, pulls the returner toward the alley and gives them many angle options – they might go down the line or sharp crosscourt at your partner. Your net partner has to respect the alley more on a wide serve. So, serving down the middle is generally safer, especially if your team likes to poach or play an “I-formation” (stacked at net). Mix in wide serves occasionally to catch opponents off-guard or if you spot that a particular returner has a weak off-wing (e.g., trouble with a backhand return when stretched wide). Spin serves: A heavy slice serve that stays low can earn weaker returns, whereas a topspin (in paddle often a kick serve with an underhand motion) is rare but can be used as a surprise to jump the ball up on the returner. Most players stick to slice or flat serves. Importantly, serve deep. A serve that lands near the service line and skids is much tougher to attack than one that sits up short. Practice hitting targets: place a towel a foot inside the service line and see if you can drop serves on it consistently. Intermediate players should practice a solid forehand (or backhand) drive return: a compact swing, a bit of topspin, aiming at the feet of the server coming in or the middle “seam” between the net players. The best returners can hit low to the server’s feet, handcuffing them. Others aim heavy spin at the net player’s right hip (if he’s a righty, that’s a backhand volley jam).

A reset overhead is used when the lob is deep or you’re off balance – you hit a controlled ball, often with more arc or depth, just to prolong the point (like a deep lob back or a high defensive overhead). An attacking overhead is used on shorter lobs or when opponents are out of position – usually flatter or with slice, aimed to force a bad return (maybe a low bounce or a jam). Key point: many overheads in paddle are hit with a lower trajectory than in tennis, meaning you don’t always contact at full high extension. Hitting at a slightly lower contact and not overly high over the net can result in a lower bounce. Tennis players have to adjust – you’re not trying to smash for a clean winner; you’re trying to produce a lower bouncing outcome. In summary, Intermediate – add slice to keep overheads low and begin targeting your overheads (find opponents’ weaknesses for placement).",

         "text": "Work on disguise and location. For example, line up your toss the same way but be able to hit T or wide or at the body. Also, practice serving and following it in: since you only get one serve, many top players immediately charge the net behind a serve (especially men’s game). This is akin to a “serve and volley” – it puts pressure on the returner to come up with a low return. To do this, as soon as you hit the serve, take a couple of quick steps forward so you’re ready to hit the first volley around the service line. (One drill is to serve and literally sprint a few steps in, to train reaction – “ take a few steps in behind the ball to simulate running to the net” on serve practice.) If you have a reliable spin serve that stays low, following it to net can be very effective at higher levels. High-level play often features drive returns as the primary choice, with lobs used strategically as a change of pace. In fact, top players prefer a controlled drive that makes the volleying team hit up, rather than an immediate lob, except when necessary. For a drive return, footwork is key: as you see the serve coming, move your feet and decide early. Short backswing, meet the ball in front, and hit through the ball (avoid chopping down, which often nets the ball). One mantra: “Never miss a return in the net” – if you’re going to miss, sail it long, because at least you gave it a chance. High percentage play is to aim your drives deep and down the middle, which reduces the angle and typically makes both opponents unsure who should take it. Advanced returning & tactics: Mix it up. If opponents are blitzing (rushing net) behind their serve, a lob return over their heads is a great counter. If they hang back, a short chip return could draw them in awkwardly. You can also target one player – for example, if one net player has a weaker volley, drive at them often. Communication with your partner is vital: use signals (like in doubles tennis) to indicate if the returner’s partner will also rush (poach) or stay. Some advanced teams run an I-formation or Australian formation when serving to counter a strong returner – as a returner, recognize these formations and adjust (usually lob over the net player who is crouched in I-formation, or aim behind the Australian-shifted player). These cat-and-mouse tactics become more important at high levels. Overall, for serve and return: Advanced – use variety and aggression (serve-and-volley, blitz returns, etc.) to seize the offensive early in the point.",

         "text": "For experienced players, work on transition and reflex skills. This includes half-volleys as you close in (those awkward scoops when you’re caught in no-man’s land), and fast reflex volley-to-volley exchanges. A fun advanced drill is two players at net just blocking back and forth quickly – it builds reflexes and comfort. Another advanced tactic: poaching. Signal your server (if you’re at net) that you’ll cut across on the return. This requires reading the returner and having confidence in your partner to cover opposite. Executed well, it can steal points. Also, practice fake poaches – a little fake move can throw off the returner’s target. When both you and your partner are up, consider yourselves a wall: maintain good spacing (about 10–12 feet apart, not too close or you’ll both get lobbed at once, not too far or you leave a gap in the middle). Constantly communicate (“got it!” “switch!” “bounce it!” if you want your partner to let a ball bounce) so that you cover everything as a team. When opponents rip a drive, often it’s best to volley it back deep and not over-attack. If the drive is heavy topspin dipping at your feet, sometimes the smart play is to let it bounce, then play it (a half-volley or let it ricochet up off the deck to volley). In platform, you can do that because the court is smaller – you’re not as far from the bounce. This is an underrated tactic to avoid volley errors on nasty dips. However, if you let it bounce, you lose some offensive positioning. To summarize volleying: Advanced – incorporate poaches, swing volleys if the chance is there, and develop intuition for which balls to attack vs which to just reset deep. When in doubt, make the opponents hit one more shot rather than going for a low-percentage winner. In platform tennis, patience at net wins matches.",

Some top players mastering angles will hit what’s called a “screen drive” where the ball barely bounces in then immediately hits the side fence and darts across – used to wrong-foot net teams. These are advanced and risky – they can easily miss. But worth mentioning as the creative side of paddle. Also, when retrieving, advanced players will sometimes let a ball go through to the screens even if they could volley it, because a volley might be weak whereas off the screen they can produce a better lob. Knowing when to let it go is an art – for instance, a ball dropping fast near your feet might be better to bounce off the back screen so you can hit it at waist height instead of half-volleying at your shoelaces.

Unlike tennis racquets, paddles have an EVA foam core that does wear out over time – expect to replace your paddle every ~2 seasons if you play a couple times a week (the foam loses its “pop” after thousands of hits). When choosing a paddle, consider: Head Size – standard (~86 sq in) vs mid-plus (~87–93) vs oversize (95+ sq in). Larger heads have a bigger sweet spot and more power, which often helps beginners (oversize is now most common). Weight – paddles range ~345–385 grams (12.1–13.6 oz), with ~370g being average. Lighter paddles are easier to maneuver and gentler on the arm; heavier ones give more stability and power but can tire you out or aggravate tennis elbow. Also check the balance : some paddles are head-heavy (powerful but can feel “heavier” to swing) versus handle-heavy (more control, less swing weight). An evenly balanced or slightly handle-biased paddle is often arm-friendly for newer players. Surface Grit: Most paddles have a sandpaper-like gritty surface to help bite the ball and impart spin. Fresh, sharp grit (and even the paddle’s drilled holes) will grab the ball better for spin shots. Over time the grit wears down, which is another reason to replace a paddle eventually. Grip size on platform paddles is typically uniform (around 4 1/4″), but you can build up with overgrips to your comfort. If you hit a two-handed backhand, look for longer grip length paddles (some have elongated handles) so you have space for the second hand. And yes – some paddles even come with quirky features like built-in bottle openers (because the post-match beverage is a paddle tradition!).",

They’re pressurized less than tennis balls and engineered to have a lower bounce, especially in cold weather. Always use official platform tennis balls; using a regular tennis ball would bounce too high and fast. In general, balls are sold by brands like Viking and Wilson as “Extra Duty” for cold temperatures. They might feel a bit “dead” at room temperature, but once on a chilly court they’ll still bounce and stay lively enough to play. Pro tip: In very cold conditions, keep spare balls in your pocket to warm them or rotate balls every few games – a warm ball bounces a bit more. According to experienced players, platform balls “have a lower bounce and are easier to control than standard tennis balls”. Replace balls regularly, as the flocking wears off and they become more erratic off the screens after several sets.",

High-end models like K-Swiss Hypercourt or Adidas Barricade are popular for their balance of comfort and durability. In winter, some players opt for waterproof trail-runners, but be cautious – those may grip too much or not slide correctly.

Also do some reverse (flexor) stretches. On court, if you start feeling twinges, more lobbing and less driving for a while can let it settle.

The fundamentals for a good volley apply at all levels: continental grip (so you can use one grip for both forehand and backhand volleys), minimal backswing (keep that paddle out in front and stable), and use your legs – bend and shift weight through the volley for stability. A good ready position at net has your knees slightly bent, weight on balls of feet, paddle up around chest height and slightly to backhand side (since ~2/3 of volleys in paddle will be backhands). In fact, it’s taught that making most of your volleys backhands creates a “wall” – you cover more reach side to side with two backhands in the middle, compared to trying to volley everything forehand. So, practice your backhand volley a ton; it will be your workhorse for reflex exchanges. When volleying, keep the paddle face slightly open and aim to contact the ball out in front of your body. The volley motion is more of a firm block or punch – efficiency is key : “hit with a minimum amount of motion, especially compared to tennis volleys”. This shorter motion is crucial for reacting to fast drives and for controlling the ball so it doesn’t pop up.",

However, both players should avoid standing too deep – “the ultimate position for the net team is as close as you can get while still volleying above net height”.

A solid volley might be one that lands around the service line at their feet or even into the screen on one bounce, so it dies. If you get a high floater, sure, put it away if you can (especially shorter court = fewer outright winners). But often the high floater is coming off a screen and isn’t as easy to kill as it looks. High-level teams will reset even relatively easy balls, choosing a high-percentage deep volley over an attempted hero shot that could go out. As a rule, do not hit volleys harder than necessary. Use placement: volley deep middle to cause confusion, or deep to a weaker side (make them hit a backhand groundstroke if possible). Hitting low toward the back screen is great – an “ideal volley” might be one that one-bounce-then-touches the back screen at ankle height, so opponents have to scrape it up.",

         "text": "Overheads in platform tennis are a world of their own. Unlike tennis where a big smash often ends the point, in paddle a big smash can backfire if it rebounds off the back screen right to your opponent. The philosophy for overheads is control, placement, and spin over sheer power. “The intent of the overhead is to hit it so that the backcourt players cannot attack it.” In practice, that means you want your overheads to bounce low or in an awkward spot, ideally forcing a weak lob or drive in return. Overhead Basics: Use a continental grip and turn sideways as soon as you see a lob coming. Footwork: shuffle back as needed, but try to get in position so you can hit the ball in front of you (better to step back and take it slightly lower than backpedal and hit directly over your head). A great tip is to move back an extra step on high lobs – keep the ball in front of your shoulder rather than directly above, which gives you more control. Think of how outfielders catch a fly ball – they position under and slightly back so they can step into the catch; similarly, on a high lob, retreat an extra step, then come forward into the overhead. Common placements: deep middle (make it bounce near the baseline center), or deep to one corner (especially to an opponent’s weaker side). The mantra is “make them hit off the back screen.” An overhead that “dies in the back screen” (bounces near the base of the back screen) is gold – it will have a low bounce, often leading to a desperate lob up. It’s safer to aim for the back screens than the side screens with overheads, because a ball that lands short near a side screen could sit up for a drive.",

This is normal in platform tennis! Stay calm, don’t rush an overhead that isn’t there. If you get tired or feel your overhead quality dropping, consider changing the pace – throw in a high lob overhead (basically give them a taste of their own medicine), or even let a lob bounce and then bounce it off the screen (rare but can reset the point).

These will greatly improve your comfort. Staying Calm: The first few times balls ricochet all around you, it’s easy to panic. But remember, you usually have more time than you think . One pro tip: actually count out loud as mentioned. It might feel silly, but by counting “1, 2, 3” as the ball goes bounce-screen-hit, you occupy your brain with a task, which strangely removes the panic and adrenaline rush . Many players report that this counting trick has been “life changing” in overcoming screen fear. As you count and successfully return balls, your confidence grows and soon the screen truly becomes your friend.

A quirk in platform: because of screen bounces, you might hit more shoulder-high drives than in tennis. To topspin a high ball, you actually need to bring your paddle back higher (near shoulder level) and come over the ball – almost a downward swing – to get topspin. This is opposite of a typical low-to-high swing taught in tennis, but if the ball is up by your ear off a screen, you can’t drop the paddle too low or you’ll frame it.

If two solid net players are up and balanced, a hard drive at them is actually what they want – they’ll angle it off or hit a winner volley. If you notice that happening (“every time we drive, they win the point”), dial back. Go back to lobbing more, or target different spots (like high at one person’s paddle side shoulder, which is harder to volley than a waist-high ball).

Off-court, visualize how you want to play in big matches, so when you’re there, your mind feels like it’s been there before.",

       "dealing_with_pressure": {
         "text": "Tight situations (tiebreakers, match points, league playoffs) test your nerves. The best players have a process to handle pressure. One technique: deep breathing . When you feel heart rate up and thoughts racing, take a couple of deep breaths, exhale slowly. This actually calms your physiology. Another is sticking to routines – do everything as you’ve done in practice. If you normally bounce the ball twice before a serve, do it now; this familiarity breeds calm. Also, keep your perspective – remind yourself “This is fun, we want to embrace this challenge” to diffuse some fear. Trust your training and focus on the process, not the outcome . For example, at 5-5 in a tiebreak, don’t think “If I miss this, we lose the set.” Instead think “OK, toss high, bend knees, hit my target” (for a serve) – focus on the actionable elements. That keeps your mind from catastrophizing outcomes.",

         "text": "Paddle can involve some very long points/games. Cultivate patience. Know that it might take 5 high lobs to draw an error – and be okay with that. The moment you get impatient (“I’m tired of lobbing, I’m gonna rip a random drive”), you often lose the plot and the point. Mentally commit to outlasting opponents. A phrase like “make them hit one more” or “grind it out” repeated to yourself can set that attitude. Enjoy the grind – reframe a 40-shot rally as a battle you’re excited to fight rather than a slog.",

If you blow an easy overhead into the net, flush it – literally imagine the mistake being flushed away or use a physical cue (tap your paddle on your shoe or turn around and look at the fence – some small action to symbolize moving on). Then refocus on the next point. Some use “erase and replace” – erase the error, replace with thinking of what you’ll do on the next point. Also, lean on your partner: sometimes a quick fist-bump or smile from them can cut the tension. As a partner, never scold your teammate for a miss – your support is crucial to keeping their head in it.",

As one platform tennis coach noted, if you practice hard, take care of fitness and strategy, and do all your preparation, you can step on court feeling you’ve “earned” confidence . Remind yourself of those things: “We drilled this, we’re ready,” “I hit this shot a hundred times last week.” Small achievements mid-match also boost confidence – like if you set a mini goal to hit 4 good returns in a row and you do it, acknowledge that internally (“yes, I’m seeing the ball well”). Goal-setting helps you focus on positives and progress, which fuels confidence. Start with small ones each match (e.g., no more than 1 double fault per set, or lob deep consistently) and celebrate when achieved.",

Did conditions change (sun came out making serves toss tricky on one side)? Then high toss serves might be tougher – adjust strategy or help your partner adapt. Mental toughness also means being ready to adjust tactics if Plan A isn’t working. Less experienced players often mentally freeze, sticking to a losing plan (“we keep driving but they keep killing us”) because frustration or nerves block adaptability. Train your mind to stay flexible: discuss with partner mid-match, “What’s working, what’s not?” and be willing to try something different.

If you find yourself getting tight or angry, use a trigger to lighten up – maybe a quick joke with your partner or purposely breathing out a chuckle. It can diffuse tension. In-match tactics for concentration: Some players like to use a keyword on each shot – like as you hit a volley, say “soft” to remind you of your desired feel, or on lobs say “high”. This keeps negative thoughts out because your mind is occupied with a task. Others use visualization between points – e.g., quickly visualize a perfect serve placement as you bounce the ball.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **Bug Identified:**
The CNSWPL player scraper had **TWO filter locations** for detecting substitute players, but only ONE was complete:

**Location 1 (Line 460):** ✅ **COMPLETE**
```python
if any(sub_indicator in player_name for sub_indicator in ['(S)', '(S↑)', '(sub)', 'substitute']):
```

**Location 2 (Line 566):** ❌ **INCOMPLETE** (before fix)
```python
if any(sub_indicator in text.lower() for sub_indicator in ['sub', 'substitute', '(sub)']):
```

### **Fix Applied:**
Updated Line 566 to match Line 460:
```python
if any(sub_indicator in text for sub_indicator in ['(S)', '(S↑)', '(sub)', 'substitute']):
```

## 🎯 Validation Methodology

### **Two-Tier Validation:**

1. **Baseline Validation** (`production_validate_no_new_s_records.py`)
   - Quick check of expected counts
   - Denise Siegel status
   - Recent (S) record creation

2. **Comprehensive Validation** (`comprehensive_s_validation.py`)
   - 9 detailed checks
   - Database integrity
   - Sample player verification
   - Match data preservation
   - Historical record analysis

### **Execution:**
```bash
# Updated baseline expectations
EXPECTED_ACTIVE_S = 0      # Changed from 170
EXPECTED_INACTIVE_S = 276  # Changed from 106

# Ran both validations
✅ Baseline Validation: PASS
✅ Comprehensive Validation: PASS
```

- 30 users have contexts pointing to (S) teams
- These are legacy contexts from before cleanup
- **Impact:** Low - users can still switch teams
- **Recommendation:** Manual review or automated cleanup script

### **2. Permanent Deletion of (S) Records**
- Currently 276 (S) records marked `is_active = false`
- Data preserved for rollback/audit
- **Recommendation:** Can permanently delete after 30-day grace period

Hi Mary Clare,

I've fixed the issue with your account - your user profile wasn't properly linked to your player record, which prevented you from accessing the availability feature.

**Your account is now working!** âœ…

You should now be able to log in and access the availability feature for your Tennaqua 7 team practices and drills.

If you still have issues, try logging out and back in.

Thanks,
Rally Support
